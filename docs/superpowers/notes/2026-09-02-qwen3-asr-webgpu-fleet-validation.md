# Qwen3-ASR WebGPU worker — fleet validation

**Date**: 2026-09-02
**Branch**: `feat/qwen3-asr-webgpu-worker` (PR 2)
**What was tested**: the real `qwen3-asr-webgpu.worker.ts` driven through the same message
protocol `AsrEngine` uses (init → Int16@24kHz audio chunks paced like the recorder → flush →
dispose), on all three fleet GPUs, against the layout-v2 model on the Hub. The harness sources
live in the job scratch dir (`worker-harness/`, plus `vite.harness.config.ts`), not committed.

## Bug found and fixed first

Every clip on every GPU decoded to repeated `!` (token 0). Cause: the worker loaded ORT from
the bare `onnxruntime-web` export, which resolves to the **wasm-only** bundle
(`ort.bundle.min.mjs`); an `InferenceSession` created there with `executionProviders:['webgpu']`
does not run on the GPU and returns flat logits. The other WebGPU workers never hit this
because their model runs through Transformers.js's own ORT. Fix (commit 363d5a0d): import from
`onnxruntime-web/webgpu` via a new `_shared/onnxruntime-webgpu.ts` shim (the entry the spike
page used; it also carries the wasm EP the VAD session needs).

## Results (real worker, per-utterance recognition time; auto = no forced language)

No worker or runtime errors and no timeouts on any clip; each clip produced one VAD segment and
no output collapsed to `!`. (Recognition quality is discussed below — "no errors" here means
the pipeline, not the transcript.)

| box | variant | jfk (en) | zh-1906 | zh-1883 (was the collapse clip) | ja-1828 | rec time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GB10 (NVIDIA Vulkan) | q4 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ correct | ✓ | 0.55–1.0 s |
| RTX 4070 SUPER | q4f16 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ correct | ✓ | 1.0–1.5 s |
| Mac mini M4 | q4f16 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ correct | ✓ | 0.58–1.0 s |

Forced language (`language <Name><asr_text>` appended), Japanese clips, all three boxes: all
transcribe, no collapse. The hard FLEURS clips show the 0.6B's expected proper-noun / kana
slips (e.g. マリア王 / ファティマ, 語りネゴ for カタルーニャ) — a model-quality limit, not a
worker bug; the same clips show the same class of error in the CPU and page runs.

Load time (cold, model already in IndexedDB): ~11 s on the fleet boxes, ~4.7 s on GB10. The
first utterance pays WebGPU shader compilation; the worker warms up on 1 s of silence during
init so the first real utterance is not slow.

## Second bug: audio dropped while a decode is running (and why the obvious fix hung)

The first worker version, cloned from the granite scaffold, `await`ed the transcription inside
`feedAudio` while holding `processingVad`, so every audio chunk that arrived during a decode
(0.5–2.5 s) was silently dropped. On the microphone path a natural pause usually follows an
utterance and hides this; on gapless system audio the loss lands on the next sentence's first
words. Fixed the way voxtral-3b does it: `void transcribe(...)` on SpeechEnd / the 20 s cap /
flush, decodes serialized through `currentDecodePromise`, and `handleFlush`/`handleDispose`
await the in-flight decode before releasing the sessions.

That change alone **hung the worker permanently** (zero results, no error, every later decode
pending). Cause: `onnxruntime-web/webgpu` runs `session.run()` on the Asyncify build of the wasm
runtime (`ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm`; `_OrtRun` is awaited, and the bundle has no run
mutex). A VAD frame's wasm-EP `run()` arriving while the GPU decode is Asyncify-suspended
re-enters the same wasm instance, which Emscripten defines as undefined behaviour. The old
`processingVad` drop was the only thing keeping the two apart. voxtral-3b never hits this
because its VAD lives on the bare `onnxruntime-web` (wasm-only bundle, its own instance) while
Transformers.js holds its own `onnxruntime-web/webgpu`. The worker now uses the same split: VAD
via `_shared/onnxruntime-all`, the model via `_shared/onnxruntime-webgpu`, `wasmPaths` set on
both envs. Rule for any future raw-ORT WebGPU worker: never run a second session on the webgpu
ORT instance while a decode is in flight — give the VAD its own instance.

A/B on the GB10 (q4, auto language), old = commit 7e032376, new = this fix, identical audio
fed as one continuous stream at 1.7× real time:

| stream | old worker | new worker |
|---|---|---|
| 4 clips back to back with their own silences (45.7 s) | 4 segments; Japanese clip lost its first second ("インターネットで" missing, segment 6.5 s) | 4 segments; Japanese complete (8.8 s); no hang; dispose clean |
| same 4 clips with head/tail silence trimmed, 34.2 s of continuous speech | 3 segments totalling 31.2 s of audio (2.9 s lost); Japanese head missing again | 3 segments totalling 33.9 s (all of it); Japanese complete |
| all 13 clips trimmed, 112.3 s of continuous speech — the 20 s cap fires twice | 8 segments, 93.6 s captured (18.7 s lost): the JFK clip and one short Japanese clip vanish entirely, and text is missing across a cap boundary ("…敲下垂直。" → "二零一一年八月完工…") | 9 segments, 109.7 s captured (the rest is VAD edge trimming); text continues across the cap boundary ("…找到自己的" → "立场，并能够…"); no hang; dispose clean |

The 20 s cap still splits a sentence mid-way — that is the cap's job — but no audio is lost on
either side of the split any more.

Where the two zh clips were hard-spliced into one segment, both workers skipped the end of the
first sentence. That is the model on an abrupt splice, not dropped audio: the new worker's
segment durations account for all of the input, the same two clips are transcribed in full when
a pause separates them, and feeding just that spliced pair as the very first segment (no decode
in flight at all) reproduces the identical omission on a 12.96 s segment out of 13.12 s.

## Coverage and gaps (stated honestly)

- The worker + the AsrEngine message contract are validated end to end on real GPUs.
- Variant selection (`selectVariant` → q4f16 with shader-f16, q4 without), readiness, blob
  URLs and engine routing are covered by unit tests (`modelManifest.qwen3Asr.test.ts`,
  `AsrEngine.qwen3.test.ts`) and share the exact machinery Granite/Voxtral use.
- **Not done on the fleet**: a full packaged-app click-through (download UI →
  ModelManagement → picker), because the fleet boxes are set up for headless Chrome, not app
  installs. The download/variant/readiness path is the shared, already-shipping one.
- **Not done**: a formal GPU-memory-over-50-utterances graph. The harness ran 4 utterances per
  session on one loaded instance with stable timing and no growth in failures; the KV cache is
  disposed every step (`greedyDecode`) and asserted by unit test.
- **GB10 `q4f16` is not applicable**: its NVIDIA/Vulkan adapter has no `shader-f16`, so the
  device correctly selects `q4`.

## `recommended` decision

PR #469 shipped with **`recommended: false`**: English and Chinese are excellent, Japanese is
usable but the 0.6B makes proper-noun errors on hard sentences (the 1.7B is the CJK quality
tier), and it is WebGPU-only, so it does not fill the "no GPU-free recommended model" gap for
Japanese users.

**Decision after the merge (jiangzhuo, 2026-09-02):** Qwen3-ASR 0.6B becomes recommended and
takes the ranking slot Voxtral Mini 3B 2507 held (`sortOrder: 3`); Voxtral Mini 3B 2507 drops
to non-recommended with Qwen3's former `sortOrder: 5`. Effect on the shared ranking
(recommended → sortOrder → size): cohere (1) and Voxtral 4B (2) still rank first wherever they
apply, so the default pick is unchanged for zh/en/ja/ko/de/fr/es/it/pt/nl/hi/ru/ar/vi; for
th, id and Cantonese the first-ranked recommended WebGPU model changes from Whisper Large V3
Turbo to Qwen3 (same `sortOrder`, Qwen3 is smaller with shader-f16). Dutch is the one Voxtral
3B language Qwen3 does not cover; cohere and Voxtral 4B still recommend for it. In the model
list Qwen3 sits exactly where Voxtral 3B sat (recommended group, after cohere and Voxtral 4B,
before Whisper Turbo by the language-tier tie-break).
