# Managed Soniox Voice Slots — Backend Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give `sokuji-backend` a 20-slot cache of Soniox voice objects — allocated on demand, kept warm between sessions, evicted LRU — plus the three endpoints the client drives it with.

**Architecture:** A `soniox_voice_slots` table keyed by `account_id` (the database enforces one slot per account, exactly as `session_leases` does). `VoiceSlotService` owns allocation and eviction as pure D1 statements, so the part most worth testing is testable without HTTP. A new `routes/soniox-voices.ts` exposes `GET /mine`, `POST /ensure` and `DELETE /mine`; the pin that protects a slot during a live session attaches to the two session handlers that already exist, and the reconciler that already proves sessions ended releases pins as a side effect.

**Tech Stack:** Cloudflare Workers, Hono, D1 + Drizzle, Better Auth, Vitest.

**Repo:** `sokuji-backend` (NOT sokuji-react — the spec lives there, the code does not).

**Spec:** `sokuji-react/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-soniox-managed-voice-slots-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- All code comments and identifiers in English. Repo comment style: say *why*, not *what*.
- `MAX_VOICE_SLOTS = 20` — Soniox's organization-wide ceiling. Mirrors the existing `MAX_STT_CONCURRENT` / `MAX_TTS_CONCURRENT` pattern in `src/config/soniox.ts`: our number must be raised in step with Soniox's, because the service refuses on OUR number.
- Reuse existing constants, never re-derive them: `KEY_START_WINDOW_S = 60`, `LEASE_MARGIN_MS = 15_000` (`src/config/soniox.ts`).
- The permanent Soniox key is `env.SONIOX_API_KEY`, already used by `createSonioxApi`. It must never leave the Worker.
- Eviction must be atomic — a single SQL statement whose effect is checked, never SELECT-then-DELETE. Two concurrent `ensure` calls must not pick the same victim, and must not both slip into the last free slot.
- Real-SQLite tests must **throw at load** when `node:sqlite` is unavailable, never `skipIf` — copy the rationale block from `src/services/session-lease.sqlite.test.ts`. Repo `.nvmrc` pins Node 24.
- Conventional commit messages. Do not push and do not open a PR — the user approves those separately.
- **Run every command on Node 24.** The repo's `.nvmrc` pins 24 and the two existing `*.sqlite.test.ts` files THROW AT LOAD on Node < 22 by design. A shell defaulting to Node 20 reports 2 failed suites and silently skips 50 more tests, which looks exactly like a regression you caused. Prefix every session:
  ```bash
  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 24
  ```
  Baseline on Node 24 before any change: **49 files / 489 tests passing, 0 skipped**.
- Run `npm test` in `sokuji-backend` before each commit.

### Task 1: Slot table and the allocator

The heart of the feature. Everything else calls into this.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/db/voice-slot.schema.ts`, `src/services/voice-slot.ts`, `src/services/voice-slot.sqlite.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/db/schema.ts`, `src/config/soniox.ts`
- Generated: `drizzle/0009_*.sql`

**Interfaces produced (later tasks depend on these exact names):**
```ts
export interface VoiceSlot {
  accountId: string; sonioxVoiceId: string;
  createdAt: number; lastUsedAt: number; pinnedUntil: number;
}
export type ReserveResult =
  | { ok: true; placeholderId: string; evictedVoiceId: string | null }
  | { ok: false; reason: "pool_exhausted"; evictedVoiceId: string | null };

export class VoiceSlotService {
  constructor(env: CloudflareBindings)
  get(accountId: string): Promise<VoiceSlot | null>
  reserve(accountId: string, now: number): Promise<ReserveResult>
  finalize(accountId: string, placeholderId: string, sonioxVoiceId: string): Promise<boolean>
  touch(accountId: string, now: number, pinnedUntil?: number): Promise<void>
  unpin(accountId: string, now: number): Promise<void>
  release(accountId: string): Promise<string | null>
}
export function createVoiceSlotService(env: CloudflareBindings): VoiceSlotService
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the constants**

In `src/config/soniox.ts`, append:

```ts
/** Soniox's organization-wide ceiling on stored voices, counted across all
 *  projects. Like MAX_STT_CONCURRENT above, this mirrors THEIR quota and must
 *  be raised in step with it — raising Soniox's alone changes nothing, because
 *  VoiceSlotService.reserve refuses on OUR number. */
export const MAX_VOICE_SLOTS = 20;

/** How long a slot is protected while its voice is being built at Soniox.
 *  Derived from the client's waitUntilReady timeout (60s) plus the usual
 *  margin, because the build is what this window has to outlast.
 *
 *  Equal to SLOT_PIN_START_MS today. Kept separate on purpose: it bounds a
 *  Soniox build, not a socket handshake, and config in this file already
 *  learned that lesson once — see MAX_SESSION_S vs TTS_KEY_MAX_TTL_S, whose
 *  comment explains why two coincidentally-equal constants must not be
 *  merged. */
export const VOICE_BUILD_PIN_MS = 60_000 + LEASE_MARGIN_MS;

/** Phase-one pin, set before a session starts, when no lease exists yet to
 *  copy an expiry from. Same expression and constants as
 *  SessionLeaseService.acquire's initialExpiry, for the same reason: it must
 *  cover "voice is ready" through session-key to socket-up. Phase two
 *  (session-started) replaces it with the lease's own expires_at. */
export const SLOT_PIN_START_MS = KEY_START_WINDOW_S * 1000 + LEASE_MARGIN_MS;
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the table**

Create `src/db/voice-slot.schema.ts`:

```ts
import { sqliteTable, text, integer, index, uniqueIndex } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

/**
 * One cached Soniox voice per account, under an organization-wide ceiling of
 * MAX_VOICE_SLOTS.
 *
 * `account_id` is the primary key, so the table itself enforces "one slot per
 * account" — there is no second row to race with. Same trick, same reason, as
 * `session_leases`.
 *
 * The reference recording is NOT here and is never stored server-side: it
 * lives in the user's browser and is uploaded only when a voice must be built.
 * That is what makes eviction cheap — whatever is evicted can be rebuilt by
 * the one party that still holds the clip.
 */
export const sonioxVoiceSlots = sqliteTable(
    "soniox_voice_slots",
    {
        accountId: text("account_id").primaryKey(),
        /** Soniox's voice UUID, or a `pending:<uuid>` placeholder while the
         *  slot is reserved but the voice has not been created yet. Unique so
         *  a duplicate can never make two accounts share one Soniox voice. */
        sonioxVoiceId: text("soniox_voice_id").notNull(),
        createdAt: integer("created_at").notNull(),
        /** LRU key. Touched by every ensure, whether it pre-warms or pins. */
        lastUsedAt: integer("last_used_at").notNull(),
        /** Protection window. Covers both "being built" and "in a session", so
         *  eviction has one rule instead of two: a row with pinned_until >= now
         *  is never a victim. */
        pinnedUntil: integer("pinned_until").notNull(),
    },
    (table) => ({
        voiceIdx: uniqueIndex("idx_voice_slots_voice_id").on(table.sonioxVoiceId),
        lruIdx: index("idx_voice_slots_lru").on(table.pinnedUntil, table.lastUsedAt),
    })
);

export type SonioxVoiceSlot = typeof sonioxVoiceSlots.$inferSelect;
```

In `src/db/schema.ts`, import and spread it exactly like the others:

```ts
import * as voiceSlotSchema from "./voice-slot.schema";
// ... inside the `schema` const: ...voiceSlotSchema,
// ... and add: export * from "./voice-slot.schema";
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Generate the migration**

Run: `npm run db:generate`
Expected: a new `drizzle/0009_*.sql` containing `CREATE TABLE soniox_voice_slots` and the two indexes. Read it and confirm before continuing — Task 1's test loads this file by name.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the failing allocator tests**

Create `src/services/voice-slot.sqlite.test.ts`. Copy the `node:sqlite` guard, `loadMigration` and `makeSqliteEnv` helpers verbatim from `src/services/session-lease.sqlite.test.ts` (same rationale — a fake D1 that maps binds by position cannot catch a column/bind drift, and the eviction statement here is exactly that shape), adjusting only the thrown message to name this file. Then:

```ts
const NOW = 1_800_000_000_000;

function seed(svc: VoiceSlotService, env: any, n: number, opts: { pinned: boolean }) {
  // Rows are inserted directly so each gets a distinct last_used_at, oldest first.
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    env.DATABASE.prepare(
      `INSERT INTO soniox_voice_slots
       (account_id, soniox_voice_id, created_at, last_used_at, pinned_until)
       VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)`

    const rows = await env.DATABASE.prepare(

});
```

Write `harness()` to build a `DatabaseSync`, exec `loadMigration("0009_<generated name>.sql")`, and return `{ svc: new VoiceSlotService(makeSqliteEnv(db)), env: makeSqliteEnv(db) }` — reuse ONE env object for both so the seeded rows and the service share a connection.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/services/voice-slot.sqlite.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `voice-slot.ts` does not exist yet.

- [ ] **Step 6: Implement the service**

Create `src/services/voice-slot.ts`:

            `DELETE FROM soniox_voice_slots WHERE account_id = ? RETURNING soniox_voice_id`
        ).bind(accountId).first();
        if (!row) return null;
        const id = String(row.soniox_voice_id);
        return id.startsWith("pending:") ? null : id;
    }
}

export function createVoiceSlotService(env: CloudflareBindings): VoiceSlotService {
    return new VoiceSlotService(env);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/services/voice-slot.sqlite.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

Note the `touch` test asserting the pin is extended uses `MAX(pinned_until, ?)`; if the "touch without a pin leaves the existing pin alone" test fails, the two branches were collapsed into one.

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the full suite and commit**

Run: `npm test`
Expected: PASS.

```bash
git add src/db src/config/soniox.ts src/services/voice-slot.ts src/services/voice-slot.sqlite.test.ts drizzle
git commit -m "feat(soniox): add the voice slot table and its LRU allocator"

### Task 2: Voice CRUD against Soniox

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/services/soniox-api.ts`
- Test: `src/services/soniox-api.test.ts` (exists — extend it)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from Task 1.
- Produces: a `VoiceStatus` type and three methods on the object
  `createSonioxApi(apiKey)` returns —
  ```ts
  export type VoiceStatus = "not_computed" | "processing" | "ready" | "failed";

  createVoice(name: string, clip: Blob, filename: string): Promise<{ id: string }>
  getVoice(id: string): Promise<{ id: string; status: VoiceStatus } | null>
  deleteVoice(id: string): Promise<void>
  ```
  Export `VoiceStatus` from `soniox-api.ts` alongside the existing `TempKey` /
  `UsageLog` interfaces; Task 3 imports it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `src/services/soniox-api.test.ts`:

```ts
describe("voice management", () => {
  it("createVoice posts multipart to /v1/voices with the permanent key", async () => {
    const fetchMock = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
      ok: true, status: 201, json: async () => ({ id: "voice-abc" }),
    });
    vi.stubGlobal("fetch", fetchMock);
    const api = createSonioxApi("perm-key");

    const out = await api.createVoice("My Voice", new Blob([new Uint8Array([1, 2])]), "clip.wav");

    expect(out).toEqual({ id: "voice-abc" });
    const [url, init] = fetchMock.mock.calls[0];
    expect(url).toBe("https://api.soniox.com/v1/voices");
    expect(init.method).toBe("POST");
    expect((init.headers as Record<string, string>).Authorization).toBe("Bearer perm-key");
    // Multipart body — the browser/Worker sets its own boundary, so no
    // Content-Type of ours may be present or the boundary is lost.
    expect(init.body).toBeInstanceOf(FormData);
    expect((init.headers as Record<string, string>)["Content-Type"]).toBeUndefined();
  });

  it("getVoice reports the tts-rt-v1 status and returns null on 404", async () => {
    vi.stubGlobal("fetch", vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
      ok: true, status: 200,
      json: async () => ({ id: "v1", models: [{ model: "tts-rt-v1", status: "ready" }] }),
    }));
    expect(await createSonioxApi("k").getVoice("v1")).toEqual({ id: "v1", status: "ready" });

    vi.stubGlobal("fetch", vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ ok: false, status: 404, json: async () => ({}) }));
    expect(await createSonioxApi("k").getVoice("gone")).toBeNull();
  });

  it("deleteVoice treats 404 as success so cleanup is idempotent", async () => {
    vi.stubGlobal("fetch", vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ ok: false, status: 404, json: async () => ({}) }));
    await expect(createSonioxApi("k").deleteVoice("gone")).resolves.toBeUndefined();
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify they fail**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/services/soniox-api.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `createVoice is not a function`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `src/services/soniox-api.ts`, add to the object returned by `createSonioxApi`:

```ts
        /**
         * Create a cloned voice. Multipart with exactly `name` + `file`, per
         * Soniox's API — no metadata or owner fields exist, which is why
         * ownership lives in our own table.
         *
         * Deliberately no Content-Type header: fetch derives it from the
         * FormData along with the multipart boundary, and setting it by hand
         * drops the boundary and makes Soniox reject the body.
         */
        async createVoice(name: string, clip: Blob, filename: string): Promise<{ id: string }> {

            if (!res.ok) {
                // Same shape as createTemporaryKey above: this module has no

                // refused (bad audio format, oversize clip, malformed

            if (res.status === 404) return null;
            if (!res.ok) {
                let body = "";
                try { body = await res.text(); } catch {}

            return { id: body.id, status: (entry?.status ?? "not_computed") as VoiceStatus };
        },

        /** 404 is success: cleanup runs from several paths (eviction, user
         *  delete, account deletion) and must never fail because someone else
         *  already removed it. */
        async deleteVoice(id: string): Promise<void> {
            const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/v1/voices/${id}`, {
                method: "DELETE",

### Task 3: The three endpoints

**Files:**
- Create: `src/routes/soniox-voices.ts`, `src/routes/soniox-voices.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/index.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `VoiceSlotService` (Task 1), `createSonioxApi(...).createVoice/getVoice/deleteVoice` (Task 2).
- Produces: `GET /api/soniox/voices/mine`, `POST /api/soniox/voices/ensure`, `DELETE /api/soniox/voices/mine`; and `createSonioxVoiceHandlers(deps)` for tests, mirroring `createSonioxHandlers` in `routes/soniox.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Widen CORS before anything else**

`src/index.ts` allows only `["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"]` on `/api/soniox/*`. `DELETE /mine` would fail its preflight in the browser with no server-side trace. Add `"DELETE"` to `allowMethods` in **both** `app.use("/api/soniox/*", cors({...}))` and `app.use("/api/soniox", cors({...}))`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing endpoint tests**

Create `src/routes/soniox-voices.test.ts`, following `src/routes/soniox.test.ts` for how it fakes auth and injects deps. Cover:

```ts
it("requires authentication", async () => {
  // no session -> 401 from every route
});

it("GET /mine returns null when the account holds no slot", async () => {
  // -> { voice: null }
});

it("GET /mine reads status through to Soniox, not from our row", async () => {
  // slot row exists; getVoice returns processing -> { voice: { status: 'processing' } }
  // and the row itself carries no status column to read.
});

it("GET /mine reports null when Soniox no longer has the voice", async () => {
  // getVoice -> null (404) -> { voice: null }, so the client knows to rebuild.
});

it("ensure with a warm slot touches it and returns ready without calling createVoice", async () => {
  // getVoice -> ready; createVoice must NOT be called; last_used_at advanced.
});

it("ensure without a clip and without a slot returns clip_required", async () => {
  // -> 409 { error: 'clip_required' }
});

it("ensure with a clip creates the voice and finalizes the slot", async () => {
  // reserve -> createVoice -> finalize; response { voiceId, status: 'processing' }
});

it("ensure deletes the evicted voice at Soniox", async () => {
  // pool full of unpinned slots -> deleteVoice called with the victim's id
});

it("ensure pokes the reconciler before reporting pool_exhausted", async () => {
  // all pinned -> poke({ blocked: true }) called, response 409 pool_exhausted
});

it("ensure with pin=1 applies the phase-one pin", async () => {
  // pinned_until === now + SLOT_PIN_START_MS
});

it("DELETE /mine refuses while the slot is pinned", async () => {
  // -> 409, and deleteVoice not called
});

it("DELETE /mine removes the row and the Soniox voice", async () => {
  // deleteVoice called with the stored id, and release runs BEFORE it
});

// The three branches this whole task exists for. Each one, if broken, silently
// leaks a voice at Soniox: the row leaves our table and nothing can reclaim it,
// costing one of twenty slots permanently. Assert the ARGUMENTS, not just that
// a delete happened — passing the wrong id here deletes the wrong voice.
it("ensure deletes the voice it just built when finalize reports it was superseded", async () => {
  // finalize -> false; deleteVoice called with created.id (NOT placeholderId,
  // NOT the account's existing voice); response 409 superseded
});

it("ensure releases the reservation when createVoice throws", async () => {
  // release(accountId) called; response 502. Without it, a row holding a
  // `pending:` id that never resolves occupies a slot until something evicts it.
});

it("ensure deletes a voice stranded by a lost eviction race", async () => {
  // reserve -> { ok: false, reason: 'pool_exhausted', evictedVoiceId: 'voice-stranded' }
  // deleteVoice('voice-stranded') called; response still 409 pool_exhausted
});

it("GET /mine leaves an in-flight reservation alone", async () => {
  // slot's sonioxVoiceId starts with `pending:` -> neither getVoice nor release
  // is called, so a concurrent GET cannot release an account's own in-flight
  // reservation
});
```

Write each body against the fake deps, asserting on the fakes' call arguments — the same style `soniox.test.ts` uses.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run to verify they fail**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/routes/soniox-voices.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — module not found.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the routes**

Create `src/routes/soniox-voices.ts` with a `createSonioxVoiceHandlers(deps)` factory (deps: `makeVoiceSlotService`, `makeSonioxApi`, `makeSonioxReconciler`) exactly like `createSonioxHandlers`, exporting production handlers wired to the real services, and a Hono router mounting:

`ensureHandler` is the whole state machine and is the part worth writing out:

```ts
async function ensureHandler(c: Context<SonioxVoicesEnv>) {
    const auth = c.get("auth");
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: c.req.raw.headers });
    if (!session?.user) return c.json({ error: "Authentication required" }, 401);
    const accountId = session.user.id;

    const form = await c.req.formData();
    const wantsPin = form.get("pin") === "1";
    const clip = form.get("clip");
    const now = Date.now();
    // Phase-one pin only. Phase two (the lease's own expires_at) is installed
    // by session-started; see the design doc's pin lifecycle.
    const pinnedUntil = wantsPin ? now + SLOT_PIN_START_MS : undefined;

    const slots = deps.makeVoiceSlotService(c.env);
    const soniox = deps.makeSonioxApi(c.env);

    // A slot row is a claim on capacity, not proof the voice exists: Soniox is
    // the authority on that, so status is always read through rather than
    // cached in our row, where it would drift on a build that finishes, fails,
    // or is deleted out of band.
    const existing = await slots.get(accountId);
    if (existing && !existing.sonioxVoiceId.startsWith("pending:")) {
        const live = await soniox.getVoice(existing.sonioxVoiceId);
        if (live && live.status !== "failed") {
            await slots.touch(accountId, now, pinnedUntil);
            return c.json({
                voiceId: existing.sonioxVoiceId,
                status: live.status === "ready" ? "ready" : "processing",
            });
        }
        // live === null (gone at Soniox) or failed (terminal) — fall through
        // and rebuild, which needs the clip.
    }

    if (!(clip instanceof Blob)) {
        // The caller holds the only copy of the recording, so only it can
        // rebuild. Telling it so is the whole protocol for a clip-less device.
        return c.json({ error: "clip_required" }, 409);
    }

    const reserved = await slots.reserve(accountId, now);
    if (!reserved.ok) {
        if (reserved.evictedVoiceId) {
            // reserve() evicted a row and then lost the freed space. Its
            // return value is the only surviving reference to that voice.
            try {
                await soniox.deleteVoice(reserved.evictedVoiceId);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("ensureHandler: stranded voice delete failed:", error);
            }
        }
        // Every pinned slot might be held by a session that has already died
        // without saying so. A sweep reads Soniox's usage logs, which only
        // appear after a session ends, and frees those pins — so contend
        // first, refuse second. Same move sessionKeyHandler makes on a 409.
        c.executionCtx.waitUntil(deps.makeSonioxReconciler(c.env).poke({ blocked: true }));
        return c.json({ error: "pool_exhausted", retryAfterMs: 3000 }, 409);
    }

    if (reserved.evictedVoiceId) {
        // Best effort: the row is already gone, so a failure here leaks one
        // voice at Soniox rather than corrupting our accounting.
        try {
            await soniox.deleteVoice(reserved.evictedVoiceId);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("ensureHandler: evicted voice delete failed:", error);
        }
    }

    try {
        // Namespaced because Soniox voice names are unique per project and
        // carry no owner field — the name is the only place provenance can
        // live on their side.
        const created = await soniox.createVoice(
            `u_${accountId}`,
            clip,
            "reference.wav"
        );
        const won = await slots.finalize(accountId, reserved.placeholderId, created.id);
        if (!won) {
            // A second reserve for this same account overwrote our slot while
            // Soniox was building. One account owns one voice, so the newer
            // request wins and this one cleans up after itself — otherwise the
            // voice we just created has no row pointing at it and never dies.
            try {
                await soniox.deleteVoice(created.id);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("ensureHandler: superseded voice delete failed:", error);
            }
            return c.json({ error: "superseded" }, 409);
        }
        await slots.touch(accountId, now, pinnedUntil);
        return c.json({ voiceId: created.id, status: "processing" });
    } catch (error) {
        // Drop the reservation, or a row holding a `pending:` id that will
        // never resolve occupies one of twenty slots until it is evicted.
        await slots.release(accountId);
        console.error("ensureHandler: createVoice failed:", error);
        return c.json({ error: "Failed to create the voice" }, 502);
    }
}
```

`mineHandler` (GET) resolves the slot, calls `getVoice`, and on `null` **releases the row before answering** `{ voice: null }` — the slot named a voice that no longer exists, and leaving the row would hold capacity for nothing. Otherwise `{ voice: { voiceId, status, createdAt } }`.

`deleteMineHandler` refuses with `409` while `pinnedUntil >= now` — a voice cannot be pulled out from under a live session — and otherwise `release`s the row and then calls `deleteVoice`, in that order, so a Soniox outage cannot block the user from removing their own voice.

Mount in `src/index.ts` next to the existing one:

```ts
import sonioxVoiceRoutes from "./routes/soniox-voices";
app.route("/api/soniox/voices", sonioxVoiceRoutes);
```

Register it BEFORE `app.route("/api/soniox", sonioxRoutes)` so the more specific prefix wins.

### Task 4: Pin phase two, and unpin on session end

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/routes/soniox.ts` (`sessionStartedHandler`, `sessionEndHandler`)
- Test: `src/routes/soniox.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `VoiceSlotService.touch/unpin` (Task 1). `createSonioxHandlers`'s deps object gains `makeVoiceSlotService`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `src/routes/soniox.test.ts`:

```ts
it("session-started raises the voice slot pin to the lease's own expiry", async () => {
  // lease row expires_at = E; after POST /session-started the slot's
  // pinned_until === E. Asserting the VALUE (not merely "it was called")
  // is the point: recomputing a duration here instead of copying the
  // lease's is exactly the bug this design avoids.
});

it("session-started still succeeds when the account holds no voice slot", async () => {
  // the common case — most sessions use a built-in voice
});

it("session-end unpins the voice slot", async () => {
  // pinned_until === 0 afterwards
});

it("a voice-slot failure never fails the session handlers", async () => {
  // make touch/unpin reject; the endpoints still return ok
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify they fail**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/routes/soniox.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `sessionStartedHandler`, after `markStarted` succeeds, read the account's lease row's `expires_at` and call `touch(userId, now, expiresAt)`. In `sessionEndHandler`, call `unpin(userId, now)`.

Wrap both in try/catch that logs and continues, matching how `sessionEndHandler` already guards `markEndSignalled`:

```ts
// A voice slot is a cache, not a lease: failing to move its pin must never
// fail the session itself. The pinned_until timestamp is the backstop if
// this call is the one that goes missing.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify they pass**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/routes/soniox.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Full suite and commit**

Run: `npm test`

```bash
git add src/routes/soniox.ts src/routes/soniox.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(soniox): pin a voice slot for the life of its session"
```

---

### Task 5: The reconciler releases pins

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/services/soniox-reconcile.ts`, `src/durable-objects/SonioxReconcilerDO.ts`
- Test: `src/services/soniox-reconcile.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `VoiceSlotService.unpin` (Task 1).
- Produces: `SweepPorts.unpinVoiceSlot(accountId: string, now: number): Promise<void>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

In `src/services/soniox-reconcile.test.ts`:

```ts
it("releasing a lease also unpins that account's voice slot", async () => {
  // Drive a sweep with one stt- usage log whose clientRefId parses to
  // accountId 'acct-1'. Assert unpinVoiceSlot was called with 'acct-1'.
  // This is the un-forgeable path: the usage log proves the session ended,
  // which is why no heartbeat is needed to bound a leaked pin.
});

it("does not unpin on a tts- log", async () => {
  // A TTS socket reconnects mid-session, so a tts- log does not mean the
  // session is over — the same reason it does not release the lease.
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify they fail**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/services/soniox-reconcile.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `unpinVoiceSlot` is not part of `SweepPorts`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Add `unpinVoiceSlot(accountId: string, now: number): Promise<void>` to `SweepPorts`. In the sweep, inside the existing `if (kind === "stt")` branch that calls `releaseLease`, also call `unpinVoiceSlot` with the accountId already parsed from the clientRefId. Wire it in `SonioxReconcilerDO.ts` next to `releaseLease`:

```ts
unpinVoiceSlot: (accountId, now) => createVoiceSlotService(this.env).unpin(accountId, now),
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify they pass**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/services/soniox-reconcile.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Full suite and commit**

Run: `npm test`

```bash
git add src/services/soniox-reconcile.ts src/durable-objects/SonioxReconcilerDO.ts src/services/soniox-reconcile.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(soniox): free a voice slot's pin when the reconciler proves the session ended"
```

---

### Task 6: Account deletion releases the slot

The one path that leaks a slot permanently if missed — an ownerless voice, built from a real person's recording, holding one of twenty places.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/auth/index.ts`
- Test: `src/auth/index.test.ts` (create if absent)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `VoiceSlotService.release` (Task 1), `createSonioxApi(...).deleteVoice` (Task 2).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```ts
it("deleting an account deletes its Soniox voice and its slot row", async () => {
  // invoke the configured deleteUser.afterDelete hook with a user id that
  // holds a slot; assert release() ran and deleteVoice() was called with the
  // stored voice id.
});

it("account deletion survives a Soniox delete failure", async () => {
  // deleteVoice rejects; the row is still gone and the hook does not throw —
  // a user must always be able to delete their account.
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/auth`
Expected: FAIL — no `afterDelete` hook is configured.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `src/auth/index.ts`, extend `deleteUser` from `{ enabled: true }` to add an `afterDelete` hook that releases the slot and deletes the voice, ordered so the row goes first:

```ts
// Row first, voice second: if the Soniox call fails we have still freed the
// slot, and the orphaned voice is a bounded leak the next eviction reclaims.
// The reverse order could leave a row pointing at a voice that no longer
// exists AND refuse to let the user delete their account.
```

Swallow and log Soniox failures — account deletion must not be blockable by a third-party outage.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/auth`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Full suite, and confirm the migration applies**

Run: `npm test`
Run: `npm run db:migrate:dev`
Expected: `0009` applies cleanly to the local D1.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/auth
git commit -m "feat(soniox): release a voice slot when its account is deleted"
```

### Task 7: Entitlement gate on the voice endpoints

Added after Task 6's review found the plan's premise was false. `/soniox/voices/*` checks only that the caller is authenticated — no balance, no frozen check, no anonymous check — while `session-key` gates on the wallet. `anonymous()` is enabled (from the initial commit; nothing in the client calls it), so **anyone can sign in anonymously twenty times and exhaust the organization's entire voice pool for free**, and better-auth's anonymous plugin deletes those users through `internalAdapter.deleteUser()` (`plugins/anonymous/index.mjs:111,158`) without ever running `deleteUser.afterDelete`, so each squatted slot also leaks permanently.

Ruling: a slot requires a real, funded account — signed in, email-verified via the normal flow, not anonymous, not frozen, with at least the minimum balance. Gating this way also makes the anonymous-deletion leak unreachable rather than requiring a second hook.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/routes/soniox-voices.ts`, `src/routes/soniox-voices.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/auth/index.ts`, `src/auth/index.test.ts` (finding I2 below)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `deps.makeWalletService(env).getBalance("user", accountId)` — already a dep of `createSonioxHandlers`; add it to `createSonioxVoiceHandlers`'s deps in the same style. `minBalanceMicroUsd(sku, MIN_SESSION_S)` from `src/services/pricing.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `src/routes/soniox-voices.test.ts`, for **each** of the three endpoints (the gate must not have a hole one verb wide):

```ts
it("refuses an anonymous account", async () => {
  // session.user.isAnonymous === true -> 403 { error: "verified_account_required" }
  // and neither the slot service nor Soniox is touched
});

it("refuses a frozen wallet", async () => {
  // getBalance -> { frozen: true } -> 403 { error: "wallet_frozen" }
});

it("refuses a balance below the floor", async () => {
  // getBalance -> below minBalanceMicroUsd("soniox:text_only", MIN_SESSION_S)
  //   -> 402 { error: "insufficient_balance" }
});

it("fails closed when the wallet cannot be read", async () => {
  // getBalance -> null (DB error, not a missing wallet) -> 503, matching
  // sessionKeyHandler's reasoning: a transient infra failure must not be
  // reported as a permission error the client reads as "don't retry"
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify they fail**

Run: `npm test -- --run src/routes/soniox-voices.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — every gate test, because the endpoints currently admit anyone authenticated.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the gate**

One shared helper in `soniox-voices.ts`, called first by all three handlers, returning either the accountId or a `Response`:

```ts
/**
 * A voice slot is one of twenty the whole organization has, so it is not
 * something a throwaway account may take. The bar is the same one a session
 * has to clear — funded, unfrozen, real — checked here rather than only at
 * Start, because `ensure` allocates the scarce resource all by itself.
 *
 * Anonymous accounts are refused outright, which also closes a leak:
 * better-auth's anonymous plugin deletes its users through
 * internalAdapter.deleteUser(), which never runs deleteUser.afterDelete, so a
 * slot held by one could never be released.
 *
 * The affordability floor uses the CHEAPEST sku: this endpoint does not know
 * which mode a later session will pick, and refusing someone who could afford
 * a subtitles-only session would gate more than the ruling asks.
 */
```

Checks in order: `session.user.isAnonymous` → `403 verified_account_required`; `getBalance` null → `503`; `frozen` → `403 wallet_frozen`; below `minBalanceMicroUsd("soniox:text_only", MIN_SESSION_S)` → `402 insufficient_balance`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Guard the account-deletion hook's own release call (finding I2)**

`src/auth/index.ts`'s `afterDelete` wraps its `deleteVoice` call but not its `release` call. A transient D1 failure on that one statement propagates out of the hook: the user is told deletion failed although the account row is already gone, and the slot row is orphaned with no owner left to release it. Wrap it the same way, with a comment saying why deletion must never be blockable. Add a test asserting the hook still resolves when `release` rejects.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the full suite**

Run: `npm test`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/routes/soniox-voices.ts src/routes/soniox-voices.test.ts src/auth
git commit -m "feat(soniox): require a funded, non-anonymous account to hold a voice slot"
```

## After the plan

The backend is then complete and independently testable, but **not yet reachable by any client** — `sokuji-react` still shows managed users built-in voices only. That is the second plan, written once this contract is real.

Deployment: nothing manual. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` applies D1 migrations
as its own step **before** the deploy step, and queues concurrent pushes rather
than cancelling them so two runs cannot race the schema.

`wrangler deploy` itself never executes SQL — it uploads the Worker and its
bindings, and `drizzle-kit generate` only writes the file. That separation is
deliberate: code deploys are frequent and reversible, schema changes are not,
and redeploying an older script would not undo a migration.

`0009` is additive and referenced by nothing that exists today, so the ordering
is forgiving in a way `0005` was not: an old Worker against the new table is
fine because it does not know the table exists, and a new Worker against a
missing table breaks only the voice endpoints, leaving sessions, billing and
the wallet untouched. `0005` was a column *rename*, which is why the runbook
treats migrate-before-deploy as load-bearing — but that hazard does not apply
here.
