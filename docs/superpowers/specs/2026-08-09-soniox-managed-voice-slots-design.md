# Managed Soniox Custom Voices — Dynamic Slot Design

**Date**: 2026-08-09
**Status**: Approved (brainstormed with user)
**Scope**: `sokuji-react` + `sokuji-backend`
**Supersedes**: the "Phase 2 — managed dynamic slots" sketch in
`2026-07-31-soniox-voice-cloning-byok-design.md`
**Related**: PR #372 (BYOK voice cloning), PR #379 (preview without a session)

## Summary

Give every Kizuna-managed Soniox user a voice cloned from their own recording,
under a hard ceiling of 20 voice objects for the entire organization.

The ceiling is structural: Soniox counts voices per organization across all
projects, and its TTS wire accepts only a registered `voice` string — there is
no inline reference audio. So 20 registered voices must serve an unbounded
number of users. They do it by becoming a **cache**: a voice is built on
demand, kept warm between sessions, and evicted when someone else needs the
slot. Slots therefore track *recently active* users, not registered ones.

The reference recording never reaches our servers' storage. It lives in the
user's browser, is uploaded only when a voice must be built, and is forgotten
by the backend the moment Soniox has it. That is what makes eviction cheap:
anything evicted can be rebuilt by the one party that still holds the clip.

## Verified constraints (2026-08-09)

- **20 voices per organization**, across all projects. Not per project, not
  per key.
- **`create` → `ready` takes ~10 s** (measured, recorded in the BYOK design).
  The voice is unusable until then.
- **The TTS wire takes `voice`, `language`, `audio_format`, `sample_rate` and
  `speed` — nothing else.** No inline reference audio (so a registered voice
  is the only route to a real clone), and no pitch/timbre knobs (so a built-in
  cannot be shaped toward a user).
- **Voice management needs the permanent org key**; temporary keys are
  live-verified 401 on `/v1/voices`. The backend already holds that key as
  `env.SONIOX_API_KEY`.
- **No voice-level ACL at Soniox** — any `tts_rt` temporary key can synthesize
  with any project voice UUID. Isolation is ours to enforce.
- **No rename and no re-point-at-a-new-clip API** — only create, delete, and
  `recompute` (for a new model). Keeping 20 stable UUIDs and rewriting their
  contents is therefore impossible.
- **Cloning is not billed** (confirmed by the account owner), so churn costs
  nothing and eviction policy is free to be chosen on UX grounds alone.
- The backend has **D1, KV and Durable Objects — no R2**.
- **Manually created voices share the same project the managed pool draws
  from** — live check on 2026-08-09 found eight, none matching the managed
  `u_` prefix. This is what makes `MAX_VOICE_SLOTS`' headroom load-bearing
  rather than decorative: the pool counts only our own table, so anything a
  human creates by hand is invisible to allocation and shows up as a Soniox
  quota failure on someone else's session. The list endpoint returns
  `tts-rt-v2` alongside `tts-rt-v1` in `models`; we read v1, which is what we
  synthesize with.
- `docs/ANALYTICS_EVENTS.md` and `sessionStartGate.ts` are shared with the
  subtitle window; see Architecture §5.

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Dynamic slots, not static claims or voice-matching | The alternatives each cut the promise: static claims cap the feature at 20 users forever; matching a user to the nearest built-in never delivers *their* voice. Dynamic slots is the only option under current constraints that keeps the promise intact and scales with concurrency rather than with registrations. |
| Reference clip lives client-side only | No biometric data at rest on our servers, so no retention or deletion obligations; no R2 to add. Eviction becomes safe because the owner can always rebuild. |
| One slot per **account** | `account_id` is the primary key, so the table itself enforces it — the same trick, for the same reason, as `session_leases`. Removes the per-account cap, the fake-device-id abuse vector, and the cross-device rebuild problem in one move. |
| No `device_id` column | After the per-account change it gated nothing. Whether *this* device can rebuild is a question the client answers from its own IndexedDB; the backend never needs to know. A real hardware id is also only obtainable on Electron — browsers withhold it as a fingerprinting vector — so the field would mean different things on different platforms. |
| Warm between sessions, LRU eviction | Cloning is free, so the only cost of keeping a voice is the slot itself, and the only benefit of deleting one is freeing that slot. Evict lazily, when the slot is actually wanted. |
| Build on voice **selection**, not on Start | Moves the ~10 s off the critical path for the common case. |
| Cold at Start blocks with progress | Honest semantics, and the case is rare once selection pre-warms. |
| Pool exhausted → built-in voice + explanation | The session still starts. |
| No heartbeat | See §2. |

## Architecture

### 1. Slot model

New D1 table (Drizzle migration `0009`):

```
soniox_voice_slots
  account_id       TEXT PRIMARY KEY      -- one slot per account, enforced by the DB
  soniox_voice_id  TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
  created_at       INTEGER NOT NULL
  last_used_at     INTEGER NOT NULL      -- the LRU key; touched by every ensure
  pinned_until     INTEGER NOT NULL      -- protection window; see §2
  INDEX (pinned_until, last_used_at)     -- serves the eviction query
```

`account_id` as the primary key mirrors `session_leases`, whose schema comment
explains the property we want: *"the table itself enforces the single-session
rule — there is no second row to race with."*

**States** (of one account's slot):

```
                    ensure(clip)

**Invariants**

1. A row with `pinned_until >= now` is never evicted. One column covers both
   "being built" and "in a session", so there is one rule rather than two.
2. Eviction is atomic: `DELETE ... WHERE soniox_voice_id = ? AND pinned_until
   < ?`, then check `changes` — never SELECT-then-DELETE, or two concurrent
   `ensure` calls pick the same victim. Same idiom as
   `SessionLeaseService.acquire`.
3. Every `ensure` touches `last_used_at`, whether it pre-warms or pins.

### 2. The pin lifecycle

The pin window cannot be "the session duration": that number is derived from
the wallet balance inside `sessionKeyHandler` (`routes/soniox.ts:34`,
`min(3600, max(60, balance/rate))`) and exists nowhere else. Copying that
computation into the voice endpoints would duplicate billing logic in a place
that has nothing to do with billing.

Instead, mirror what the lease already does — a two-phase TTL:

- **Phase one — `ensure(pin=1)`**, before Start, when no lease exists yet:
  `pinned_until = now + KEY_START_WINDOW_S*1000 + LEASE_MARGIN_MS` (75 s).
  Same expression and same constants as `SessionLeaseService.acquire`'s
  `initialExpiry`, for the same reason: it must cover "voice is ready" through
  session-key to socket-up.
- **Phase two — the existing `session-started` endpoint**: raise
  `pinned_until` to the account's lease row's `expires_at`. Read it, never
  recompute it. The slot's protection window and the session's billing window
  then share one clock and cannot drift.

`LEASE_MARGIN_MS` is the existing 15 s constant (`config/soniox.ts:45`,
*"Slack added to a lease's deterministic expiry"*): it absorbs client/server
clock skew and the gap between computing an expiry and the socket actually
opening.

The build window gets its own constant even though it evaluates to the same
75 s today (`waitUntilReady`'s 60 s timeout + `LEASE_MARGIN_MS`). It bounds a
different thing — a Soniox build, not a socket handshake — and `config/soniox.ts`
already made exactly this call for `MAX_SESSION_S` vs `TTS_KEY_MAX_TTL_S`,
whose comment warns that merging two coincidentally-equal constants silently
breaks when one of them moves.

**Why no heartbeat.** `max_duration_s` is a ceiling, not a prediction: a user
with a large balance who talks for three minutes and then force-quits would
hold a slot for nearly an hour. A heartbeat is the standard fix, but this
codebase already owns a better signal. Soniox usage logs appear only after a
session ends (measured 2–4.5 s), which makes "a log exists" un-forgeable proof
that the session is over — `soniox-reconcile.ts:451` already releases leases on
exactly that basis. Slots ride along: **when a sweep releases an account's
lease, it unpins that account's slot too.**

What makes this sufficient is that a leaked pin only hurts when the pool is
contended, and contention is the trigger that heals it: before returning
`pool_exhausted`, `ensure` pokes the reconciler with `blocked: true` — the same
move `sessionKeyHandler` already makes on a lease 409 (`routes/soniox.ts:205`)
— which sweeps, proves the dead sessions dead, and frees their slots within
seconds. When nobody is contending, a stale pin costs nothing.

A heartbeat would also be *weaker*: a lying client can hold a slot forever by
continuing to send one, which the usage-log path structurally cannot do.

Three layers, in order: `session-end` (immediate, trusted because lying only
hurts the liar — the same argument `markStarted` documents), the reconciler
(un-forgeable, contention-triggered), `pinned_until` (backstop for a reconciler
outage).

### 3. Endpoints

A new file, `sokuji-backend/src/routes/soniox-voices.ts`, mounted at
`/soniox/voices`. Not added to `routes/soniox.ts`: that file is already 390+
lines carrying lease acquisition, concurrency ceilings, dual-key minting and
409 retries, and voice lifecycle is a different concern.

| Endpoint | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /mine` | — | `{ voice: null }` or `{ voice: { voiceId, status, createdAt } }`. `status` is read through to Soniox (`GET /v1/voices/{id}`) rather than cached in our row — the row would go stale against a build that finishes, fails, or is deleted out of band, and a 404 here is exactly the signal that the slot must be rebuilt |
| `POST /ensure` | multipart: `pin` (`0`/`1`), `clip` (file, optional) | `200 { voiceId, status: 'ready' }` — slot live; `last_used_at` touched, pin applied if asked<br>`200 { voiceId, status: 'processing' }` — created or still building; client polls `GET /mine`<br>`409 { error: 'clip_required' }`<br>`409 { error: 'pool_exhausted', retryAfterMs }` — reconciler poked first<br>`502` — Soniox create failed |
| `DELETE /mine` | — | deletes at Soniox and drops the row; `409` while pinned — a voice cannot be pulled out from under a live session |

`ensure` is idempotent for a warm slot: it only refreshes `last_used_at`.

It returns as soon as the voice exists rather than blocking ~10 s for `ready`,
and the client polls — which reuses the polling shape `waitUntilReady` already
implements on the frontend.

Two existing handlers each gain a few lines (`session-started` raises the pin,
`session-end` clears it) and the reconciler gains one port. No new lifecycle
endpoints.

### 4. Service layer

`VoiceSlotService`, shaped after `SessionLeaseService`: `ensure`, `pin`,
`unpin`, `evictLru`, `release`. Pure D1, no HTTP, so the allocator — the part
most worth testing — is testable directly.

### 5. Frontend

**Clip storage.** A **separate** IndexedDB database (`sokuji-voice-clip`), not
a new store in `sokuji-models`: raising that database's version blanks the
Models UI on any older branch sharing the browser profile, which has bitten
this project before. One record: `{ blob, createdAt }`.

**The seam.** `SonioxVoiceSection` currently constructs a `SonioxVoicesClient`
inside itself from `settings.apiKey`, with `managed` short-circuiting it to
`null`. Lift that out: the section takes a source, and stops knowing where
voices come from.

```ts
interface VoiceLibrarySource {
  list(): Promise<SonioxVoice[]>;
  create(name: string, clip: Blob): Promise<SonioxVoice>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
  waitUntilReady(id: string): Promise<SonioxVoice>;
}
```

`SonioxVoicesClient` already satisfies it. `ManagedVoiceSource` implements it
against the endpoints above and returns a zero-or-one-element list, so the
section's list UI is unchanged.

**The stored voice id is not stable.** `settings.voice` holds the Soniox UUID,
exactly as it does for a BYOK clone — but a managed slot that is evicted and
later rebuilt comes back with a *different* UUID. Every `ensure` response is
therefore authoritative: whenever it returns a `voiceId` that differs from the
stored one, the client writes the new value through `onUpdate({ voice })`
before using it. Nothing else in the pipeline needs to change, because
`buildSessionConfig` and the TTS wire treat `voice` as an opaque string.

**Preparing the voice at Start.** In `connectConversation`, after the gate
allows the session and before `connect()`: `ensure(pin=1)`, poll to `ready`,
show progress.

This does **not** belong in `computeStartGate`. That function is pure and is
called by the subtitle window, a sibling React tree; an async, uploading,
ten-second side effect inside it would destroy the property that lets both
surfaces share one answer.

**The `pool_exhausted` notice is appended after `connect()` returns**, never
before: `connectConversation` resets the rendered list, so anything appended
earlier is wiped. Only items the *client* holds survive that reset — the trap
PR #383 documented.

### 6. Consent

Reuse `SonioxCloneConfirmModal` and its mandatory checkbox (PR #372). The
wording needs a managed variant: the recording is sent to Kizuna AI and passed
on to Soniox to build the voice, and is **not stored on our servers**. One new
locale key across all 30 catalogs.

## Failure paths

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Soniox returns `voice_failed` (terminal) | Prompt to re-record; BYOK already maps this code |
| `pool_exhausted` at Start | Built-in voice; explanation appended after connect |
| No clip on this device | `clip_required` → offer to record here |
| Voice deleted at Soniox out of band | Next `ensure` 404s and rebuilds from the local clip |
| Connect slower than 75 s, slot evicted before `session-started` | TTS gets `voice_not_found`; the existing `handleTtsError` already reports that spoken output stopped while transcription continues. Not fatal |
| Upload fails / offline | `ensure` errors; Start aborts with a retry, or the user picks a built-in |
| Account deleted mid-session | `afterDelete` removes the voice; TTS degrades. Rare, accepted |
| Reconciler unavailable | `pinned_until` backstop |

## Testing

`VoiceSlotService` against **real `node:sqlite`**, following
`session-lease.sqlite.test.ts` — a fake database hides SQL bugs, and the suite
must *fail* rather than skip on Node < 22:

- allocation into an empty pool
- allocation when full evicts the oldest unpinned row
- allocation refuses when all 20 are pinned
- **concurrent allocation: exactly one wins** (the atomic CAS)
- both pin phases, and unpin
- account deletion drops the row and the Soniox voice

Route level (mirroring `soniox.test.ts`): authentication required,
`clip_required`, and that `pool_exhausted` really pokes the reconciler.

Reconciler: releasing a lease also unpins that account's slot.

Frontend: clip storage round-trip; `ManagedVoiceSource` satisfies
`VoiceLibrarySource`; the Start-preparation step's three outcomes (warm,
building→ready, pool-exhausted fallback); and a **BYOK regression pass** — the
seam change is the riskiest frontend edit here.

## Not doing

Heartbeats; cross-device clip sync; more than one voice per account; voice
rename (no API — the BYOK design already declined it); an admin UI for the
pool.

### 7. Entitlement, and the reaper

Two things the original design missed, both found in review and added:

**A slot is not free to take.** `/soniox/voices/*` originally checked only that
a caller was authenticated, while `session-key` gates on the wallet — and
`anonymous()` has been enabled since the backend's initial commit with nothing
in the client calling it, so anyone could sign in anonymously and squat the
organization's whole pool for free. Worse, better-auth's anonymous plugin
deletes its users through a path that never runs `deleteUser.afterDelete`, so
every squatted slot would also leak permanently. All three endpoints now refuse
anonymous accounts; `ensure` — the only verb that *allocates* — additionally
requires a readable, unfrozen wallet holding at least
`minBalanceMicroUsd("soniox:text_only", MIN_SESSION_S)`. `GET`/`DELETE` are
deliberately exempt from the wallet checks: refusing to let a user *release* a
slot, or delete a voice model built from their own recording, because they ran
out of money is backwards on both scarcity and privacy grounds.

No `emailVerified` check: this app sets `requireEmailVerification: false`
globally, so unverified accounts already start sessions and spend money.
Gating voices on it alone would cost legitimate users and buy no defence — a
funded wallet means a completed Stripe payment, a far higher bar than an email.

**Deleting at Soniox is best-effort, so something must sweep up.** Six paths
can strand a voice — a failed delete on eviction, on the stranded-eviction
refusal, on supersession, on user delete, on account delete, and an isolate
dying between `createVoice` returning and `finalize`. Each one permanently
shrinks the pool, and because allocation counts only our own table, the
eventual symptom is Soniox quota errors surfacing as 502s to arbitrary users
with nothing pointing at the cause. A reap pass on the cron heartbeat deletes
any voice that is ours by name prefix, absent from `soniox_voice_slots`, and
older than the build window — guarded so it can never fail a billing sweep,
and alarming when the surviving count exceeds what we believe we hold.

Voice names are unique per build (`u_<accountId>_<token>`), not per account:
Soniox enforces name uniqueness per project, so a constant name meant one
failed pre-create delete would brick that account forever and destroy a
stranger's warm voice on every retry.

`MAX_VOICE_SLOTS` is **17**, not 20 — three of Soniox's twenty are reserved for
manual and operational voices, because one hand-made voice against a pool that
claimed the whole quota would make the next managed create fail at Soniox while
our table insisted there was room.

## Known limitations

- **20 concurrent cloned-voice sessions is the ceiling.** The 21st gets a
  built-in voice with an explanation. Raising it means asking Soniox for a
  larger quota; nothing in this design changes if that number moves.
- **A voice is only rebuildable from a device holding the clip.** Warm slots
  work anywhere the user signs in; a cold slot on a clip-less device needs a
  fresh recording there. This follows from storing the clip client-side.
- **The build takes ~10 s and cannot be hidden** when a session starts cold —
  only moved off the critical path by pre-warming at selection.
- **Unpinning is account-scoped, not lease-scoped.** A delayed or retried
  `session-end` belonging to an *older* session can clear a newer session's
  pin — no reconciler outage required, since `sessionEndHandler` carries no
  lease id. The consequence is bounded: the slot becomes evictable early, and
  if it is actually evicted mid-session the TTS wire returns `voice_not_found`,
  which the client already degrades to subtitles. Closing it means having the
  client send the `leaseId` it already holds and scoping the unpin the way
  `markStarted` and `getExpiresAt` already scope theirs.
- **The reaper's census is project-scoped while Soniox's quota is org-wide**,
  so its divergence alarm is a lower bound.
- **The reaper's age check depends on `created_at` in the list payload.**
  Verified live (2026-08-09): every item carries it, alongside `id`, `name`,
  `filename` and `models`. The field is still optional in the type, so a future
  payload change would make the reaper silently inert rather than loudly
  broken — which is why it should log how many candidates it skipped for
  unestablishable age.
