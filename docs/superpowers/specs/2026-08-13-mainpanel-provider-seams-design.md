# MainPanel Provider Seams — Design

**Date**: 2026-08-13
**Status**: Approved (brainstormed with user; audit run against `575c0c86`, spec verified against `5d4633fa` — MainPanel identical at both; adversarially reviewed, 29 findings incorporated)

## Summary

Remove provider-specific logic from `MainPanel.tsx` by widening `ProviderDescriptor` — the repo's own declared deep module ("answers *every* question about one provider", CONTEXT.md) — with the seams it is missing. After this refactor MainPanel dispatches on **capabilities and data, never on provider identity**; its only provider-naming call is `ProviderConfigFactory.getDescriptor(provider)`.

This is a pure refactor: **zero behavior change**, staged so every stage lands independently, is independently revertible, and deletes the MainPanel branches it replaces in the same commit that adds the seam.

## The problem, measured

A ten-agent audit of `MainPanel.tsx` (4509 lines) catalogued **75 provider-specific touchpoints covering 1314 unique lines — 29% of the file** — verified complete by mechanical grep cross-check. Every provider appears; the largest blocks:

| Lines | Providers | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ~56 | kizuna_ai_soniox | managed lease budget countdown: state L1409-1452, JSX ×2 L4302-4306/L4448-4452 |
| ~37 | kizuna soniox, local ×2 | provider-specific init-label ladder ×2 L4262-4273/L4395-4404 + state/plumbing |
| ~150 | all eleven provider tags | `createParticipantSessionConfig` direction-reversal switch (L934-1085; the 14 registered descriptors map onto these 11 tags — 3 kizuna twins reuse base tags) |
| ~85 | kizuna_ai_soniox | managed cloned-voice preparation (L1974-2058, applied at L2245-2264) |
| ~120 | kizuna_ai_soniox | managed lease lifecycle: acquire (L2112-2184), release inside `afterBothLegs` (L1840-1851), abort release (lease portion of L2661-2699) |
| ~71 | openai | WebRTC→WebSocket fallback (L2287-2357) |
| ~79 | openai family | anti-drift anchor policy + wiring (L3794-3874) |
| ~30 | local ×2 | pre-start model-readiness revalidation (L1918-1947) |

History shows extraction alone does not arrest this: 8 pure-decision modules were extracted while the file grew 2527 → 4509 lines over the last true six months (+78%, 163 commits in that window; 283 lifetime), because each new provider mechanism still lands in MainPanel first — the descriptor cannot answer the question, so MainPanel switches on the enum.

The settings side (`ProviderSpecificSettings.tsx`) already dispatches on `config.capabilities.*`; MainPanel is the side that fell behind the repo's own standard.

## Gap → seam → stage map

The abstraction audit identified 12 gaps; one further touchpoint (mode vocabulary) is folded in:

| # | Audited gap | Seam | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Participant (reverse-direction) session config | `buildParticipantSessionConfig` | S2 |
| 2 | Text-input support (hardcoded 5-provider list) | `capabilities.supportsTextInput` | S1 |
| 3 | System-instructions source (local prompt) | `capabilities.usesLocalPromptTemplate` | S1 |
| 4 | Transport policy (palabra forced webrtc) | `capabilities.forcedTransport` | S1 |
| 5 | PTT finalization strategy | `capabilities.pttFinalization` | S1 |
| 6 | Text queueing while AI responds | `capabilities.queuesTextWhileResponding` | S1 |
| 7 | Pre-start re-validation (local models) | `prepareToStart` + `revalidate` port | S4 |
| 8 | Managed session lease lifecycle | `acquireSessionResources` / `SessionResources` | S6 |
| 9 | Managed cloned-voice preparation | `prepareToStart` | S5 |
| 10 | Both-mode session shape | `planBothMode` | S3 |
| 11 | Auto-source reversal blocking | `reversesDirectionViaSourceLanguage` | S3 |
| 12 | Analytics enrichment | `describeSessionForAnalytics` | S8 (optional) |
| + | Mode-name vocabulary (`isPttLikeMode`) | `capabilities.pushGatedModes` | S1 |

## Decisions

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | Widen `ProviderDescriptor` / `ProviderCapabilities`; no new registry, no parallel dispatch machinery |
| Dispatch rule | Capabilities and data only; `getDescriptor()` is the single provider-naming call left in MainPanel |
| Settings write-back | **Expose the existing module-private `updateProviderSlice(set, sliceKey, patch)` helper** (settingsStore.ts:685-701, already registry-driven via `PROVIDER_SLICE_REGISTRY`) as a public store action keyed by `descriptor.settingsSliceKey`. The write path is already generic internally; only the public surface is per-provider today. |
| `excludesNativeCapture` | **Dropped from the design.** `supportsWebRTC` already encodes native-WebRTC-capture semantics (palabra declares `false` while always running webrtc transport). S1 instead *re-documents* `supportsWebRTC` to say what it actually means, and adds only `forcedTransport`. |
| S8 hard cases (analytics, anchor policy, WebRTC fallback) | Specified here, staged last, **individually optional** — decided after S1–S7 land |
| Behavior | Unchanged. The full suite (2489 tests / 207 files at `5d4633fa`) passes at every stage boundary. A test may be relocated/rewired **only** when its stage moves the call site it wires, and the stage PR must list every modified test with the seam that moved it. |
| Comments | The per-provider rationale comments in the switches (e.g. palabra's code-space note at L1003-1017, the textOnly lease rule at L2140-2153) **move with the code** |

## Tier 1 — static capability flags (`ProviderCapabilities`)

Optional fields; only providers that deviate from the default declare them. Same home the settings side already reads.

```ts
export interface ProviderCapabilities {
  // ... existing fields ...

  /** Provider accepts typed text input into a live session. Default false.
   *  Kills MainPanel's hardcoded five-provider list. */
  supportsTextInput?: boolean;

  /** Queue text typed while the AI is responding, flush after. Default false
   *  (send immediately). Kills the OPENAI/OPENAI_COMPATIBLE special case. */
  queuesTextWhileResponding?: boolean;

  /** How a push-to-talk segment is finalized on release. Default
   *  { response: 'voice-gated' }. Kills usesLocalSileroVad() and the
   *  VOLCENGINE_AST2 five-silence-frame special case. */
  pttFinalization?: {
    silenceTailFrames?: number;          // trailing silence frames to flush VAD
    response: 'always' | 'server-decides' | 'voice-gated' | 'voice-gated-cancel';
  };

  /** Turn-detection mode names that behave as push-gated. Kills
   *  isPttLikeMode()'s knowledge that 'Disabled' is OpenAI's spelling of PTT. */
  pushGatedModes?: string[];

  /** System instructions come from the local prompt template
   *  (getProcessedLocalPrompt) instead of the shared system-instructions
   *  builder. Default false. Read by MainPanel when producing the (swapped)
   *  instructions it passes into buildSessionConfig /
   *  buildParticipantSessionConfig. */
  usesLocalPromptTemplate?: boolean;

  /** Transport this provider must run on, overriding the user preference.
   *  Kills the inline PALABRA_AI→'webrtc' mapping at L819. */
  forcedTransport?: TransportType;
}
```

S1 also updates `ProviderDescriptor.supportsWebRTC`'s doc comment to its real meaning ("MainPanel starts no native recorder; the client owns capture over WebRTC transport") — palabra's `supportsWebRTC = false` while always running webrtc transport is what falsifies the current comment.

`descriptorRegistry.test.ts` gains invariants covering **every** new flag: `pushGatedModes entries are unique non-empty strings drawn from the provider's settings vocabulary (turnDetection.modes is a settings-UI list — often empty — and is NOT a superset of the speech-mode vocabulary)`; `pttFinalization.silenceTailFrames` only with `response` set; `forcedTransport` implies the provider actually supports that transport; `usesLocalPromptTemplate` only on providers whose slice carries a local prompt; boolean flags simply asserted present-or-defaulted for all 14 registered descriptors.

## Tier 2 — sync config-transform methods (`ProviderDescriptor`, base defaults)

```ts
interface ProviderDescriptor {
  // ... existing ...

  /** Session config for the participant (reverse-direction) channel.
   *
   *  Returns null when this provider cannot run a participant leg right now
   *  (local providers: no ASR engine, memory exceeded) — MainPanel maps null
   *  to the existing participant-skip path (splitParticipantFailure =
   *  'no-participant-config'). `notices` carries the user-facing
   *  participant.error/.warning/.info events those branches emit today;
   *  MainPanel forwards them to addRealtimeEvent (side effects stay in the
   *  component, per house rule).
   *
   *  Base impl: buildSessionConfig(slice, swappedInstructions) + the two
   *  truly generic participant overrides (textOnly: true, semantic-VAD turn
   *  detection). Providers whose direction lives in config fields override to
   *  also reverse those fields; gemini's override additionally forces
   *  turnDetectionMode: 'Auto' (today's L949-951, which is gemini-only, NOT
   *  generic). `shell` carries the store-shell fields the old path read
   *  (keepReplayAudio). */
  buildParticipantSessionConfig(
    slice: unknown,
    swappedInstructions: string,
    shell: { keepReplayAudio: boolean },
  ): {
    config: SessionConfig | null;
    notices: Array<{ channel: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info'; message: string }>;
  };

  /** Session shape for Both mode. Base: { shared: false, split: false }.
   *  Soniox overrides by delegating to sonioxBothModePlan. */
  planBothMode(slice: unknown, mode: string): { shared: boolean; split: boolean };

  /** Whether this provider+model reverses translation direction by swapping
   *  the source language (auto-source gating). Base: false. */
  reversesDirectionViaSourceLanguage(model: string | null | undefined): boolean;

  /** Flat analytics fields describing a session config. Base extracts
   *  `model`; providers with multi-model pipelines override. S8 — optional. */
  describeSessionForAnalytics(config: SessionConfig): Record<string, string | number>;
}
```

Direction-reversal helpers (`reverseTranscriptionDirection`, `reverseGeminiTranslationDirection`, volcengine/soniox/palabra field swaps) move into the respective descriptors as private implementation of `buildParticipantSessionConfig`, comments intact. (Landed as descriptor-imported sibling modules rather than inlined private code — they keep their own unit tests; and S2 additionally relocated the two local participant-config helpers out of settingsStore into services/providers/localParticipantConfig.ts, since a descriptor cannot import settingsStore.)

**Import hygiene (subtitle window), stated operationally**: the Electron subtitle window already transitively loads every descriptor and client (SubtitleApp → settingsStore → all descriptors), so no *new* weight is added there. The rule that must hold is narrower: subtitle-loaded **leaf modules** (`sessionStartGate.ts` and friends) keep consuming **derived primitives** (`sonioxBothSplit` stays an input computed by the caller); they never import a descriptor or the relocated `sonioxBothModePlan` module. S3 adds a test asserting `sessionStartGate.ts` has no import path to `ProviderConfigFactory` (landed as a direct-import whitelist + name scan on the gate file, plus a leaf assertion on sonioxManagedMinBalance — transitivity holds because every sanctioned import is itself import-free).

## Tier 3 — optional async lifecycle hooks

`connectConversation` is already async; ordering is unchanged — only ownership moves.

### `prepareToStart?`

```ts
type PrepareOutcome =
  | { ok: true;
      sessionPatch?: Partial<SessionConfig>;      // e.g. voice override
      settingsPatch?: Record<string, unknown>;    // via updateProviderSlice
      /** Two-phase stale-selection guard, mirroring today's L2029 + L2254:
       *  - expect: the pre-prepare slice values. Checked once when the hook
       *    returns; on mismatch MainPanel discards settingsPatch AND
       *    sessionPatch AND noticeKey and proceeds with Start unmodified
       *    (today's guard 1).
       *  - expectAtApply: the post-patch values. Re-checked immediately
       *    before merging sessionPatch into the built session config — after
       *    the intervening awaits (audio init, client construction) — on
       *    mismatch the sessionPatch is dropped and the notice suppressed,
       *    Start proceeds (today's guard 2). */
      expect?: Record<string, unknown>;
      expectAtApply?: Record<string, unknown>;
      noticeKey?: string }                        // i18n key for a user notice
  | { ok: false; message: string };               // blocks Start; display-ready text

interface PreparePorts {
  getAuthToken: () => Promise<string | null>;
  userId: string | null;
  /** Re-runs provider validation via the STORE action (validateApiKey) and
   *  reports the outcome. Exists because the revalidation authority IS
   *  settingsStore.validateApiKey — a store action with slice-writing side
   *  effects that a descriptor must not import (settingsStore imports every
   *  descriptor; the reverse edge is a cycle). MainPanel binds this port. */
  revalidate: () => Promise<{ valid: boolean; message?: string }>;
  onPhase: (phaseKey: string) => void;            // drives the generic init label
  signal: AbortSignal;                            // Start cancelled / aborted
}

prepareToStart?(slice: unknown, ports: PreparePorts): Promise<PrepareOutcome>;
```

**Landed correction (S4)**: `onPhase` carries a structured `InitPhase` union — `{ phase: 'loading-models'; completed: number; total: number } | { phase: 'loading-native-asr' }` — not the bare `phaseKey: string` sketched above; the loading-models label interpolates `completed`/`total` counts, which a bare key cannot carry.

**Landed correction (S5)**: `PreparePorts` gained `sessionShape: { speakerWillStart: boolean; participantWillStart: boolean; textOnly: boolean }`, not sketched above — provider-agnostic facts the component owns; the kizuna-soniox hook gates on them instead of re-deriving (it prepares a voice only when the speaker channel will actually speak). `onPhase`'s parameter is `InitPhase | null`, not the bare `InitPhase` the S4 correction above describes — `null` clears the phase (a hook's `finally`). The `InitPhase` union itself gained a third member, `{ phase: 'preparing-voice' }`. And `PrepareOutcome.noticeKey` (the sketched i18n key) never landed; `notice?: string` shipped instead — display-ready text the hook itself resolves (S4-T3 precedent: hooks own i18n), not a key for MainPanel to look up.

**Error paths (normative)**: a *rejected* `prepareToStart` is treated as `{ ok: false, message: t('mainPanel.startPreparationFailed') }` — MainPanel catches, logs the original error, blocks Start, shows the generic message. If `ports.signal` has fired, the result (or rejection) is discarded silently and nothing is shown. `message` on an explicit `ok: false` is display-ready text (the local hook passes the store's `validationMessage` through verbatim, as today).

Absorbs, per provider:
- **local_inference / local_native**: pre-start model-readiness revalidation (L1918-1947). The hook calls `ports.revalidate()`; `valid: false` → `{ ok: false, message }`. Store writes stay in store land.
- **kizuna_ai_soniox**: managed cloned-voice preparation (L1974-2058 + apply at L2245-2264). The existing pure core (`prepareManagedVoice` / `resolveVoicePrepOutcome`) is reused as-is inside the descriptor hook; MainPanel applies the returned patches generically under the two-phase guard above.

### `acquireSessionResources?` / `SessionResources`

```ts
/** Provider-neutral; the soniox descriptor adapts its SonioxBudgetSnapshot. */
interface BudgetSnapshot { remainingMs: number; totalMs: number }

interface SessionResources {
  /** Per-leg additions to ClientOptions (today: the sonioxManaged bundle). */
  legClientOptions(role: 'speaker' | 'participant'): Partial<ClientOptions>;
  /** Present iff the session runs on a metered budget. Drives the generic
   *  countdown UI; returns null while unknown. */
  budget?: () => BudgetSnapshot | null;
  /** Idempotent. 'aborted' = Start failed mid-flight; 'disconnect' = normal.
   *  Called from afterBothLegs (both teardown sites) — see S6 scope note. */
  release(reason: 'disconnect' | 'aborted'): void;
}

acquireSessionResources?(ctx: {
  getAuthToken: () => Promise<string | null>;
  wiring: {
    speakerWillStart: boolean; participantWillStart: boolean;
    sharedBoth: boolean; splitBoth: boolean;
    /** Effective session text-only-ness, resolved by MainPanel as
     *  `speakerWillStart ? shellTextOnly : true` — a participant-only session
     *  must never buy speech output. The rule and its rationale comment
     *  (today's L2140-2153) live at the MainPanel computation site; the
     *  descriptor consumes the resolved value. */
    textOnly: boolean;
  };
  /** Closed vocabulary: 'session.retry' is the only event the lease emits
   *  today (per the L2155-2178 comment). MainPanel forwards it to
   *  addRealtimeEvent; unknown event types are ignored. */
  onEvent: (type: 'session.retry', data: unknown) => void;
}): Promise<SessionResources | null>;
```

- Base: undefined → MainPanel treats as `null` (no resources).
- **Error path (normative)**: `acquireSessionResources` must either return resources or **throw after cleaning up its own partial state** (`ManagedSonioxSession.end()` is already idempotent and no-ops without a lease, so the wrapper's catch can call it safely). MainPanel catches the throw, aborts Start through the existing abort path, and surfaces the error message. MainPanel **never** calls `release()` for a failed acquire.
- **KizunaAISonioxProviderConfig** implements it by wrapping today's `resolveManagedSonioxWiring` + `ManagedSonioxSession.acquire()` + `managedLegOptions`.
- **S6 scope, corrected by review**: within the teardown block L1793-1852 only `afterBothLegs` (L1840-1851, ~12 lines) is lease logic — the speaker/participant leg closures are provider-generic and **stay in MainPanel**, as does `teardownSessionLegs` and its nested-finally ordering ("every leg is down before session-end is signalled"). `release('disconnect')` is called from `afterBothLegs`; `release('aborted')` from the lease portion of the abort path (L2661-2699).
- `ClientOptions.sonioxManaged` keeps its name and shape (churn control), but is now produced *and* consumed inside the same descriptor module.
- MainPanel holds one provider-agnostic `sessionResourcesRef: SessionResources | null`.

**Landed correction (S6)**: `onEvent`'s closed vocabulary is TWO members, not the one sketched above — `'session.retry' | 'session.started_refused'`. The single-member claim was stale against `ManagedSonioxSession`, which has always had two emission sites: `'session.retry'` on the acquire path's 409 retry, and `'session.started_refused'` when a session-started report comes back refused. `ProviderDescriptor`'s `onEvent` type carries both members; `KizunaAISonioxProviderConfig` forwards the session's own untyped `(type: string, data: unknown) => void` sink into `ctx.onEvent` through a narrowing cast — the same escape `SonioxClient` used when it emitted these types itself.

**Landed correction (S6)**: `legClientOptions` returns `{}`, never `undefined` — the sketch's `Partial<ClientOptions>` return type above is exact, not shorthand for an optional value. `KizunaAISonioxProviderConfig`'s implementation spreads `managedLegOptions(role, session, wiring)` into `{ sonioxManaged: options }` when that helper returns a value, and into `{}` otherwise. `createAIClient`'s second parameter widened accordingly, from a `sonioxManaged`-only shape to `Partial<ClientOptions>`, spread onto the client options it builds; its credential-skip branch is keyed on `legOptions?.sonioxManaged` rather than any provider check, so every leg without the bundle falls through to the ordinary `extractCredentials` path unchanged.

**Landed correction (S6)**: the ref discipline the normative error path above implies is now explicit — MainPanel assigns `sessionResourcesRef.current` exactly once, after `acquireSessionResources` resolves successfully; there is no earlier "set the ref, then null it back out on failure" step. When the descriptor throws (having already run its own cleanup, per the normative path above), the ref is simply never written, so `afterBothLegs` finding it still `null` and skipping `release()` falls out of ordinary control flow rather than a dedicated guard.

**Landed correction (S6)**: the countdown's data source — `sessionResourcesRef.current?.budget`, polled once a second — moved onto `resources.budget` in S6, a stage ahead of the `<SessionCountdown>` extraction below (forced: S6 deletes the ref-based state the old ladder read). The `<SessionCountdown>` component extraction and the deletion of the countdown's own state block / duplicated JSX are unaffected by this and remain S7 work, exactly as that bullet already describes.

**Landed correction (S6)**: the `prepareToStart` aborter sketched in Tier 3 above (`ports.signal`, and the "discarded silently" rule) went live in S6, together with one addition the sketch didn't carry — a Start re-entry guard (`connectInProgressRef`) that blocks a second `connectConversation` call outright while one is in flight. The guard is load-bearing for the aborter, not incidental: without it a second Start would allocate a second `AbortController` and overwrite `prepareAbortRef`, leaving the first prepare's controller unreachable and unabortable. `disconnectConversation` fires `prepareAbortRef.current` immediately after setting its own re-entry guard; `KizunaAISonioxProviderConfig.prepareToStart` additionally checks `ports.signal.aborted` itself right after its network call resolves and returns `{ ok: true }` (no patches) when fired — belt-and-suspenders with MainPanel's own discard check, not a substitute for it.

### UI becomes data-driven

- **Countdown**: new `<SessionCountdown getSnapshot={...} />` component (owns the 1s interval, the low-threshold class, `formatRemainingTime`). Rendered when `sessionResources?.budget` exists — a data condition, not a provider condition. Kills the duplicated JSX at L4302-4306/L4448-4452 (the adjacent generic session-duration span L4299-4301/L4445-4447 stays) and the state block L1409-1452.

  **Landed correction (S7)**: `<SessionCountdown>` landed with props `{ active: boolean; getSnapshot: () => BudgetSnapshot | null }` and a self-nulling render (`if (!countdown) return null;` inside the component) — the budget gate lives inside the component itself, not as the conditionally-rendered, `getSnapshot`-only sketch the bullet above implies. The state block S7 deleted was not the sketch's `L1409-1452` — those anchors were already stale by the time S7 landed: S6 had regeared the countdown's data source onto `sessionResourcesRef.current?.budget` behind a new `getBudgetSnapshot` callback (see the S6 landed correction under the `acquireSessionResources` sketch above), and it is that regeared block S7 deleted, at the callback's own declaration site next to `sessionResourcesRef`. `formatRemainingTime` itself did not move file — it still lives in `src/utils/formatters.ts` — but its only call site did, moving with the countdown state it already accompanied: from MainPanel's footer JSX into `<SessionCountdown>`, import included.

- **Init labels**: the generic `initPhaseKey: string | null` + i18n-lookup label is introduced **in S4** (not S7), so every migration stage deletes its own rungs of the old ladder as its provider moves to `onPhase` — no interim gap where migrated providers have no label. Existing label strings are reused under phase keys; no visible text changes. S7 removes whatever remains of the ladder alongside the countdown work.

  **Landed correction (S4)**: one visible text change did land — the advanced footer now shows `simplePanel.loadingModel` ("Loading model…") during a native ASR load, in place of the generic `mainPanel.initializing` ("Initializing..."), matching what the simple footer always showed.

  **Landed correction (S7)**: "S7 removes whatever remains of the ladder" above was a no-op in practice — by the time S7 landed, S4 through S6 had already deleted every migrated provider's rung as each moved onto `onPhase`; no provider was left on the old ladder for S7 to remove. S7's own diff touches no init-label code; it only extracts the countdown.

## Explicitly staged-last (S8, individually optional)

1. **`describeSessionForAnalytics`** — also absorbs the four uncovered `provider || Provider.OPENAI` analytics-tag fallbacks (L853, L920, L1598, L1671; four more sit inside the WebRTC block below).
2. **Anti-drift anchor policy** (openai family, L3794-3874) — Tier-1 flag `needsAnchorPolicy` + extraction of the anchor logic into a module beside the OpenAI descriptor.
3. **WebRTC→WebSocket fallback** (openai, L2287-2357) — descriptor property `transportFallback?: TransportType` + a generic retry step in `connectConversation`. Registry invariant: `transportFallback` and `forcedTransport` are **mutually exclusive**, and `transportFallback` must differ from the primary transport. Highest risk: entangled with connect error flow; do last, alone.

## Out of scope (deliberate)

- No change to any provider's wire behavior, session semantics, or UI appearance.
- No async `createClient` — Tier 3 hooks make it unnecessary.
- No unification of Local Inference / Local Native beyond shared flags (CONTEXT.md forbids a unifying layer).
- `ProviderSpecificSettings.tsx` (2380 lines, its own dispatch hybrid) — separate effort.

## Stages

Each stage: add seam (+ base default) → migrate providers → **delete the MainPanel branches it replaces** → extend `descriptorRegistry.test.ts` invariants → add/extend wiring tests. One PR per stage; any stage is a stable stopping point. Estimates are post-review corrected.

| Stage | Content | MainPanel deletions | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Tier-1 flags (6) + `supportsWebRTC` re-doc | ~120 | registry invariants for all flags; enum-ladder call sites replaced; full suite green |
| S2 | `buildParticipantSessionConfig` | ~150 | **golden test**: for every registered descriptor, new output deep-equals old `createParticipantSessionConfig` for the same inputs (incl. the null cases and notices); capture retired after landing |
| S3 | `planBothMode` + `reversesDirectionViaSourceLanguage` | ~40 | sessionStartGate import-hygiene test added; both-mode wiring tests moved with call site |
| S4 | `prepareToStart` + `revalidate` port + public `updateProviderSlice` + generic init label | ~45 | updateProviderSlice round-trip tests (patch merge, unknown key rejected, no cross-slice bleed); local revalidation wiring test; rejection→generic-message test |
| S5 | Migrate managed voice prep onto `prepareToStart` | ~100 | `voicePrepWiring` tests relocated and passing; **both** expect-mismatch branches asserted (guard 1 discards all, guard 2 drops sessionPatch + notice) |
| S6 | `acquireSessionResources` / `SessionResources`; migrate lease | ~95 | release-ordering assertion: release fires from afterBothLegs after both legs are down; abort path releases with 'aborted'; failed-acquire = no release() call; `managedSonioxSplit` tests intact |
| S7 | `<SessionCountdown>` + remaining ladder removal | ~55 | component render test (interval, low threshold); countdown gated on budget presence; no `soniox`-named identifier left in MainPanel render tree |
| S8 | Optional: analytics, anchor policy, WebRTC fallback | ~200 | per-item; WebRTC fallback keeps its own retry-path tests |

**Projected**: MainPanel −600..−650 lines for S1–S7; ~−800..−850 if all of S8 lands. (The audit's 1314 provider-specific lines exceed the deletions because a share becomes generic data-driven code that stays, and imports/types shrink rather than disappear.)

**Landed correction (S7)**: the S7 row's `Content` column (`<SessionCountdown> + remaining ladder removal`) undersells what actually landed — an in-flight Start became cancellable, beyond anything sketched for this stage. The S6 `prepareToStart` aborter (see the S6 landed correction under `acquireSessionResources` above) became a Start-scoped `AbortController` that also survives through `acquireSessionResources` itself, with a post-acquire `release('aborted')` when the signal fires while that await is in flight. `ManagedVoicesClient` gained a caller-`AbortSignal` path through its `request`/`mine`/`ensure` methods, following the `SonioxTtsRest` precedent's shape — a manual `AbortController` plus a `forwardAbort` listener, not `AbortSignal.any` — so an in-flight managed-voice network call is actually interrupted, not merely ignored. Both footer buttons now dispatch to `disconnectConversation` while `isInitializing` is true, behind a new `mainPanel.clickToCancel` locale key (added to all 30 locale catalogs); on the advanced button this also drives a `trackEvent('session_control_clicked', { action: 'cancel' })` call, which widened `AnalyticsEvents['session_control_clicked'].action` in `src/lib/analytics.ts` from `'start' | 'stop'` to `'start' | 'stop' | 'cancel'`. One deliberate, small visible-behavior change rode along: the advanced button's `disabled` expression lost its explicit `|| isInitializing` disable (it is no longer disabled while initializing, so its cancel click is reachable); the simple button's `disabled` expression gained a matching `&& !isInitializing` clause for the same reason.

## Testing

- **Per-seam table tests**: each new descriptor method/flag gets a test iterating all 14 registered descriptors (house style: `descriptorRegistry.test.ts` invariants).
- **Behavior-preservation**: the full suite passes at every stage boundary. Wiring tests (`voicePrepWiring`, `splitDegradedWiring`, `participantTelemetryWiring`, `managedSonioxSplit`) may move only with their call site, itemized per stage PR.
- **S2 golden test** as specified in the stage table — the largest single behavioral surface gets an exhaustive equivalence check.
- **Store**: `updateProviderSlice` (public surface) gets persistence round-trip tests.
- Full suite + `vite build` green at every stage boundary.

## Risks

- **Hot path** (`connectConversation`) is touched by S4–S6. Mitigation: sync-only stages land first; each stage minimal and independently revertible; wiring tests assert ordering.
- **Store surface** grows by one public action. Mitigation: it wraps the existing registry-driven private helper; round-trip tested.
- **S2 equivalence** is the largest behavioral surface. Mitigation: golden comparison across all descriptors, null paths and notices included.
- **Anchors drift** as stages land — stage plans reference identifiers, not line numbers (line numbers in this spec are valid at `5d4633fa`).
