# Qwen3-ASR-0.6B in the browser lane — feasibility spike

**Date**: 2026-09-02
**Tracking**: #465 (re-asks #148)
**Status**: spike complete — **GO**, plan at the end
**Artifacts**: `benchmark/qwen3-asr-webgpu/` (page, runners, export/quantize scripts, raw
results and `results/summary.txt`)

## Question

Can Qwen3-ASR-0.6B run in `LOCAL_INFERENCE` (the shipped browser WebGPU/WASM lane, Electron
renderer and extension alike) fast enough for live translation, without waiting for
transformers.js — which as of 4.2.0 has no Qwen3-ASR class and no onnx-community export?

## Answer

Yes, on WebGPU. With an int4 decoder the whole pipeline runs at **RTF 0.09–0.14 on an
RTX 4070 SUPER, an Apple M4 and the GB10's own GPU** (warm), transcripts identical to the
Python reference, Chinese/English/Japanese all correct on the test set except the model's own
0.6B-class errors. Without WebGPU (wasm EP) it is RTF 3.0 single-threaded and 0.64 with 8
threads: not usable, so the model stays `requiredDevice: 'webgpu'` like Granite/Voxtral.

## Approach

Own ONNX export + a raw onnxruntime-web page. Nothing from transformers.js at runtime: the
page computes Whisper-style log-mel itself, builds the fixed prompt from token ids, runs three
ORT sessions (encoder, prefill, step) and decodes tokens with a 40-line byte-level BPE decoder
read from `tokenizer.json`.

- Export: [andrewleech/qwen3-asr-onnx](https://github.com/andrewleech/qwen3-asr-onnx)
  (`qwen-asr` 0.0.6 / transformers 4.57.6 / torch 2.14 CPU), one local patch so the prefill
  graph emits last-position logits only (`qwen3-asr-onnx-last-token-logits.patch`; upstream's
  full-sequence logits would be a ~120 MB GPU→CPU readback per utterance).
- Quantization: `MatMulNBitsQuantizer` RTN 4-bit, block 64, accuracy level 4 → `int4` (fp32
  activations). `q4f16` = onnxruntime's float16 converter on top of the int4 graphs with
  RMSNorm/softmax/rotary ops kept in fp32 (`to_q4f16_ort.py`) plus a pass that drops the
  duplicate Cast nodes the converter emits (`dedupe_values.py`). Encoder: FP32 export and the
  pipeline's native-fp16 export (fp32 I/O).
- KV cache stays on the GPU: `preferredOutputLocation: 'gpu-buffer'` for
  `present_keys/values`, fed straight back as `past_*`, old buffers disposed each step.
- Harness: headless Chrome driven over CDP (`run_page.mjs` / `run_page.py`), models served
  from the GB10 box over LAN. WebGPU needs a secure context, so the LAN origin is passed with
  `--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`.

## Correctness

- FP32 ONNX vs PyTorch (`validate.py`): encoder max abs diff 1.6e-6; decode **30/30 tokens
  identical** on `jfk.wav` (en) and `ja-fleurs1828.wav` (ja).
- JS log-mel vs the Python reference: same frame count, max abs diff 1.8e-5. JS tokenizer
  decode equals `transformers` decode on zh/ja/en/emoji samples.
- Browser transcripts equal the Python int4 transcripts string for string.
- Clips: `jfk.wav` (en, 11 s), 4 Japanese Common Voice sentences (5–10 s), 4 Japanese and
  4 Chinese FLEURS sentences (8–15 s), all with reference text. "CER" is a rough character
  error rate after stripping spaces/punctuation; the references use Arabic digits where the
  model writes numerals as words, so a few CERs overstate the error (`zh-fleurs1883`:
  "15米 / 2011年" vs "十五米 / 二零一一年").

## Speed

RTF = (mel + encoder + prefill + decode) / audio seconds, warm runs. The first utterance of a
session pays shader compilation (RTF 0.2–0.3 once). Load times include the LAN download and
are not representative. `ms/token` is the median per-step decode time.

### WebGPU, Windows 11, RTX 4070 SUPER, Chrome 152 headless

| variant | clips | median RTF | max RTF | ms/token | encoder ms (10 s clip) | prefill ms | mean CER |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| int4 + fp32 encoder | 8 | 0.139 | 0.211 | 38 | 31–50 | 28–78 | 0.045 |
| int4 + fp16 encoder | 3 | 0.115 | 0.116 | 34 | 35–38 | 44–62 | 0.015 |
| q4f16 + fp16 encoder | 4 | 0.133 | 0.145 | 40 | 28–80 | 52–80 | 0.032 |

### WebGPU, Mac mini M4, macOS 26.6, Chrome 152 headless

| variant | clips | median RTF | max RTF | ms/token | encoder ms (10 s clip) | prefill ms | mean CER |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| int4 + fp32 encoder | 8 | 0.127 | 0.164 | 20 | 84–160 | 285–696 | 0.045 |
| int4 + fp16 encoder | 3 | 0.116 | 0.117 | 19 | 89–128 | 489–515 | 0.015 |
| q4f16 + fp16 encoder | 3 | 0.111 | 0.112 | 20 | 90–92 | 455–495 | 0.015 |

Reading: on the M4 the fp16 encoder halves encoder time; fp16 decoder activations change
nothing on either GPU (q4f16 is within noise of int4 on the M4 and the 4070), so q4f16's
value is the ~290 MB smaller download, not speed. The Mac's prefill (0.45–0.7 s for 120–220 tokens) is the slowest stage and is
where a follow-up would look (the fp32 embedding gather and the un-fused RMSNorm are the
suspects). On the 4070 the step loop is dispatch-bound at 34–38 ms/token — a 0.6B q4 step
is a few ms of compute — so the win there is fewer, fused kernels, not a faster GPU.

### CPU reference, GB10 (Grace, aarch64), onnxruntime 1.29 Python, 8 threads

| variant | median RTF | max RTF | mean CER (13 clips) | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FP32 | 0.169 | 0.266 | 0.095 | |
| int4 block 64 | 0.074 | 0.096 | 0.157 | `zh-fleurs1883` collapses to "Current." (see Quality) |
| int4 block 32 | 0.082 (5 clips) | — | — | `zh-fleurs1883` correct; +70 MB |
| int8 block 64 | 0.077 (5 clips) | — | — | `zh-fleurs1883` still collapses |
| int4 + fp16 encoder | 0.075 | — | — | fp16 encoder is not faster on CPU (Cast overhead), as upstream documents |

### wasm EP in the browser (the no-WebGPU / extension-CPU case), GB10 Chromium, int4

| threads | median RTF | ms/token | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (no COOP/COEP — what the extension has today) | 2.97 | 1040 | unusable |
| 8 (COOP/COEP served) | 0.64 | 232 | not live-capable; ~9× slower than native ORT CPU on the same box |

### WebGPU, GB10 (Grace + Blackwell GB10, aarch64 Linux, NVIDIA 580 Vulkan), old headless shell 151

| variant | clips | median RTF | max RTF | ms/token | encoder ms (10 s clip) | prefill ms | mean CER |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| int4 + fp32 encoder | 8 | 0.091 | 0.149 | 25 | 30–40 | 42–81 | 0.062 |
| int4 + fp16 encoder, q4f16 | — | refused: adapter has no `shader-f16` ("Program Transpose requires f16") | | | | | |

`chrome --headless=new` never holds a WebGPU adapter on this box (GPU process dies with
`CreateCommandBuffer kTransientFailure` under every Vulkan flag set tried); the old
`chromium_headless_shell` binary does, with `--use-vulkan=native --disable-vulkan-surface`.
Two things this box adds: an NVIDIA/Vulkan adapter can lack `shader-f16`, so the fp16
artifacts must be gated on the feature, not the vendor; and the same int4 graph picks a
different token on one Japanese clip than the 4070/M4 did (fp32 accumulation differs per
backend), so per-device transcripts can differ at knife edges even without quantization
changes.

## Sizes (bytes on disk, MiB)

| file | size |
|---|---|
| `encoder.onnx` (fp32) | 717 |
| `encoder.fp16.onnx` | 359 |
| `decoder_init.int4.onnx.data` | 834 (int4 layers + the **fp32** embedding gather table, ~590 of it) |
| `decoder_step.int4.onnx.data` | 325 (int4 layers + int4 lm_head) |
| `decoder_init.q4f16.onnx.data` | 524 |
| `decoder_step.q4f16.onnx.data` | 307 |
| `embed_tokens.fp16.bin` | 297 |
| tokenizer + config | 14 |

The spike layout is wasteful: the embedding table exists three times (inside `decoder_init`,
inside `decoder_step` as lm_head, and as `embed_tokens.fp16.bin`). A production export with
one shared weights file and one fp16/int8 embedding lands at roughly **0.9–1.0 GB** for the
fp16-encoder + q4f16 package, versus 1.49 GB for the Granite Speech 4.1 2B q4f16 already in
this lane.

## Quality notes

- 0.6B is strong on Chinese and English; Japanese is usable but makes kana/kanji and
  proper-noun errors on the harder FLEURS sentences (CER 0.17–0.27 on two clips, 0.00–0.07 on
  the rest). This matches the model card (1.7B is the CJK quality tier).
- **The one hard failure is a first-token knife edge, not a precision floor.** On
  `zh-fleurs1883` the quantized decoder sometimes skips its own `language <X><asr_text>`
  prefix and emits "Current." + EOS: int4/b64 fails (CPU and WebGPU alike), int4/b32 passes,
  int8/b64 fails, FP32 passes. **Teacher-forcing the prefix fixes every variant**: appending
  the tokens of `language Chinese` + `<asr_text>` to the prompt yields the correct transcript
  with int4 and int8 (`results/cpu-int4-forcezh.json`, `cpu-int8-forcezh.json`), and the same
  for Japanese. Sokuji always knows the source language, so the worker should force the prefix
  whenever a source language is selected and fall back to auto only for "auto". This also
  removes the language-ID mistakes a 0.6B model would otherwise make on short utterances.
- Language ID (when not forced) was right on every clip and can be shown in the UI for free.

## Go / no-go

**Go.** All four risk items from the research note came out on the right side: the export
runs on ORT-web's WebGPU EP on both GPU families we can test, the JS front end matches the
Python one numerically, speed has 7–9× headroom over real time, and the one quality defect
has a cheap product-side fix. CPU-only users get nothing from this model in the browser lane;
that was expected and does not change with any quantization.

## Productization plan

1. **Export layout** (Python, 1–2 days): one shared external-data file (`share_weights.py`
   pattern), embedding stored once (fp16 or int8) and used for both the prefill gather and the
   step lookup, prefix-forcing prompt support, `q4f16` (block 32) for `shader-f16` devices with
   `q4` fallback, fp16 encoder; fuse RMSNorm (`optimize_graphs.py`) before quantizing and
   re-measure the Mac prefill; re-run the token-exact validation and the 13-clip CER sweep per
   variant. The spike artifacts are on the Hub at
   [`jiangzhuo9357/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-ONNX`](https://huggingface.co/jiangzhuo9357/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-ONNX)
   (uploaded 2026-09-02 with `upload_hf.py`, public; the `kizuna-ai-lab` org does not exist
   on the Hub, jiangzhuo chose the personal namespace); the production layout replaces it in
   the same repo.
2. **Worker** (`src/lib/local-inference/workers/qwen3-asr-webgpu.worker.ts`, 2–3 days): clone
   the Granite worker's VAD + message plumbing; replace `generate()` with the prefill/step loop
   from `www/main.js`; mel from `mel.js` (a radix FFT instead of the 400-point DFT if the
   100–250 ms/utterance matters) or transformers.js `WhisperFeatureExtractor` with
   `feature_size: 128` once proven identical; tokenizer via `AutoTokenizer` (already in the
   shared transformers chunk) or the 40-line decoder; strip / force the `<asr_text>` prefix.
3. **Manifest + types + engine** (1 day): `modelManifest.ts` row (`requiredDevice: 'webgpu'`,
   `q4f16` **and the fp16 encoder** together under `requiredFeatures: ['shader-f16']` — the
   GB10's NVIDIA/Vulkan adapter has no `shader-f16` and ORT-web refuses fp16 graphs there —
   with `q4` + fp32 encoder as the fallback, 16 languages, `hfModelId`),
   `asrWorkerType` union, `AsrEngine.ts` dispatch, `harness-consolidation.test.ts`, locales,
   `consoleLedger` rows if the worker logs.
4. **Validation on the fleet** (1 day): the same 13 clips through the real worker on the
   RTX 4070 and the M4, plus a 60-second continuous clip for VAD segmentation; check memory
   stays flat across 50 utterances (KV buffers disposed); a cold-start budget for the first
   utterance (shader compile ≈ 1–2 s).
5. Optional later: 1.7B variant (~1.8 GB, needs ≥4 GB VRAM); an upstream
   `Qwen3ASRForConditionalGeneration` PR to transformers.js modelled on `voxtral` — an outward
   act, needs separate approval.

## Layout v2 (2026-09-02, PR 1 — plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-02-qwen3-asr-onnx-layout-v2.md`)

What changed versus the spike layout: the prefill graph takes `input_embeds` (the client
builds the prompt embedding from the one external table, so no embedding lives in any graph
and the tied `lm_head` is now an int4 MatMulNBits weight instead of an fp32 gather table);
both decoders of a precision share one weights file; the embedding table ships as per-row
int8 + fp32 scales; RMSNorm is fused (`SimplifiedLayerNormalization`) and the fp32 encoder
gets `BiasGelu` / `SkipLayerNormalization` fusions; int4 block size 32; a `prompt_config.json`
carries the prompt ids, the per-language `language <Name><asr_text>` prefix ids, the audio-token
formula, embedding and decoder dims, and the per-variant file roles. Tooling:
`benchmark/qwen3-asr-webgpu/export_v2/`; raw numbers: `results/v2-notes.md`, `results/v2-summary.txt`.

### Sizes (MB on disk)

| variant | encoder | decoder graphs | shared weights | shared files (embedding int8 156 + scales 0.6 + tokenizer/config 14) | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `q4` | `encoder.onnx` 746 (fused) | 2 × 0.4 | `decoder_weights.int4.data` 382 | 171 | **≈ 1.30 GB** |
| `q4f16` | `encoder.fp16.onnx` 376 | 2 × 0.4 | `decoder_weights.q4f16.data` 345 | 171 | **≈ 0.89 GB** |

(spike layout: 1.9 GB / 1.5 GB.)

### Correctness

FP32 v2 token-identical to FP32 v1 on the en/ja/zh check clips, before and after fusion,
with fp32 and with int8 embedding rows; fused encoder output within 6.5e-6 of the unfused
one. int4/b32 and q4f16: ja and zh token-identical to FP32, en differs by one punctuation
token; the `zh-fleurs1883` collapse is gone. CPU sweep over 13 clips: mean CER 0.125
(spike int4/b64: 0.157), no collapses, forced prefixes leave the texts unchanged.

### Speed — the compact layout is faster, not slower

| device | variant | spike RTF / ms·token | v2 RTF / ms·token | prefill spike → v2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mac mini M4 | q4 | 0.127 / 20.1 | **0.091 / 18.6** | 285–696 → 88–201 ms |
| Mac mini M4 | q4f16 | 0.111 / 19.8 | **0.076 / 16.6** | 455–495 → 59–135 ms |
| GB10 (NVIDIA Vulkan) | q4 | 0.091 / 25.3 | **0.081 / 20.8** | 39–81 → 37–64 ms |
| RTX 4070 SUPER | q4 | 0.139 / 38.3 | **0.095 / 24.1** | 28–78 → 25–71 ms |
| RTX 4070 SUPER | q4f16 | 0.133 / 40.5 | **0.087 / 21.4** | 52–80 → 25–73 ms |
| GB10 CPU, ORT 1.29, 8 thr | int4 | 0.074 | 0.071 | |

Two causes: 30 % fewer decoder nodes in a dispatch-bound loop, and no 622 MB fp32 gather in
the prefill (the host builds the prompt embedding from the int8 table in 2–6 ms). The forced
prefix path was exercised in the browser too (Mac, four Japanese clips, identical text, three
fewer generated tokens).

### Hub

`jiangzhuo9357/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-ONNX` now holds only the v2 files (18) — see the model card
