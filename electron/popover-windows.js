// Visibility bridge for the subtitle bar's popover child windows.
//
// The renderer hosts those popovers in frameless child windows it opens with
// window.open (see src/components/Subtitle/ChildWindowPopover.tsx). They are
// created once and reused, so opening a popover costs a show + move instead
// of a native window creation — but a DOM Window has no visibility API, and
// "parking" windows off-screen does not survive the window manager: mutter
// clamps both the initial position and runtime moveTo back onto the screen
// (measured: a window parked at (-10000, 0) sat at (0, 32), fully visible).
// So the main process owns visibility: popover windows are created hidden
// via a setWindowOpenHandler override — show:false from the very first
// frame — and shown/hidden over IPC.

// ('screen-saver', see topmost-level.js), so a floating popover is covered
