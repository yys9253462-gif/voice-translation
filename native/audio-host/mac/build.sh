# compiler's scratch output. Copying is part of the build, not a step to
# remember - the Windows helper lost a debugging round trip to exactly that gap.
#
# resources/bin is gitignored: these are build artifacts, produced by CI before
# packaging (npm run build:audio-host) and never committed. Changing main.swift
# is therefore the whole change; there is no binary to refresh in the repo.

# not. macOS 14.2 is the floor for Core Audio process taps.
