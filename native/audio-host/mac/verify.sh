# Acceptance test for sokuji-audio-host on macOS (issues #335, #393).
#
# Proves the four properties the per-application path rests on:
#   1. Continuity  - the stream flows at the right rate while the target is
#      silent, so nothing downstream has to fill gaps.
#   2. Late start  - an application that is not playing when the session starts
#      is still captured once it does. Its audio process objects do not exist
#      yet at that moment, and refusing to start on that basis refused most
#      applications most of the time.
#   3. Retargeting - when the target replaces the child that renders its audio -
#      what Chrome does with its audio.mojom.AudioService - capture follows it
#      instead of going permanently silent on a dead object.
#   4. Isolation   - a target that never plays yields silence while another
#      process is audibly playing, i.e. the tap did not widen to everything.
#
# The audio assertions need the "System Audio Recording Only" grant, which TCC
# attributes to the *responsible* process - here the terminal, not this script.
# Without it every sample is zero by design; the script detects that, keeps the
# structural assertions and skips the ones it cannot judge.
#
# Expected output ends with VERIFY OK.
