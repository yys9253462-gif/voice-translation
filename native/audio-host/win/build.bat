REM Build sokuji-audio-host.exe. Requires VS Build Tools with the C++ workload.
REM Deliberately a single cl invocation: no CMake, no NuGet, no WIL.

REM Locate the compiler. Three cases, in order:
REM   1. cl is already on PATH - a developer's VS prompt, or CI after
REM      ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd. Nothing to set up.
REM   2. vswhere finds an installation - any edition, any year. The runners
REM      carry VS 2022 Enterprise, not the 2019 Build Tools this used to pin,
REM      so a hardcoded path builds on one machine and fails on the other.
REM   3. Neither - fail loudly rather than half-build.
REM cl being on PATH is not enough: an x86 developer prompt provides one too,
REM and it would produce a 32-bit helper that the 64-bit app cannot launch.

REM /utf-8 pins the source charset. Without it MSVC decodes the file with the
REM machine's ANSI code page (932 on the Japanese-locale test box) and warns
REM C4819, which would silently mangle any non-ASCII literal added later.
REM version.lib provides GetFileVersionInfo*, which reads the FileDescription
REM resource the picker labels each application with.
