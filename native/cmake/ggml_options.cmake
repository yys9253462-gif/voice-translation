# Every lane, every model: ggml 0.22.0's GGUF reader fills an array KV one element at a
# time (`gguf_reader::read(std::vector<T>&, n)` loops `read(dst[i])`, and each of those is
# a read_raw through the reader callback — one locked fread() per element). audio.cpp
# stores a model's sidecar files as ONE `audiocpp.embedded_files.data` UINT8 array KV, and
# it reopens the model GGUF 14 times per load, so the cost is 14 * (array bytes) freads:
# 800M of them for supertonic-3, which is 13.7s of its 14.0s load on the GB10 dev box
# (measured: 106% CPU, 0 major faults, 12/14 poor-man's-profiler samples inside
# _IO_acquire_lock_fct under gguf_read_emplace_helper<unsigned char>). The patch reads the
# whole array in one call, guarded by an INCLUSION list (`std::is_arithmetic_v<T> &&
# !is_same_v<T, bool>`) so anything else — strings, vector<bool>, and any type a future pin
# adds with a converting read() overload — keeps the per-element loop. Byte-identical
# output for the types it covers: it is a read-shape change only.

# ggml 0.22.0's Metal backend implements no GGML_OP_DIAG_MASK_INF at all - no supports_op
# case, no kernel - while ggml-cpu, ggml-vulkan and ggml-cuda all do. Every audio.cpp
# attention block reached without an explicit mask builds that op (16 call sites across 13
# files under audio.cpp 0.7.0's src/, external/ excluded; on our five families the live
# ones are moss_tts_nano and qwen3_tts), and audio.cpp never uses
# ggml_backend_sched, so there is no per-node CPU fallback: the single missing kernel
# aborts the process. The patch re-adds the kernel ggml's own Metal backend carried until
# llama.cpp moved to masked soft_max_ext, so it restores an op every other backend has
# rather than inventing one. Metal lane only: it touches src/ggml-metal/, which no other
# lane compiles.
#
# The second Metal gap on the same families: ggml 0.22.0's Metal GGML_OP_PAD pads only at
# the END of an axis (its supports_op rejects any non-zero leading pad), while ggml-cpu and
# ggml-vulkan both implement the full lp/rp form ggml_pad_ext builds. qwen3_tts's speech
# tokenizer decoder pads causally - left_pad = kernel_extent - stride, in
# tokenizer_speech_decoder.cpp's causal_conv1d - so every one of its depthwise convs is a
# leading pad. The patch teaches kernel_pad_impl the leading pads with exactly ggml-cpu's
# non-circular semantics; circular padding stays unimplemented, as upstream leaves it.
