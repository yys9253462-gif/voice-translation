"""Apply a JSON-specified list of exact-text patches to files under a source tree.

usage: patch_upstream.py <source_dir> <spec.json> [<spec.json> ...]

Several specs may be given; their entries are concatenated in order, so one
upstream can carry both an always-on portability patch and a lane-specific one.

<spec.json> is a list of {"file": <path relative to source_dir>, "old": <exact
text>, "new": <exact text>} objects. JSON strings carry real newlines, so a
patch can span multiple lines with no CMake/shell escaping needed.

For each entry: if <new> is present and <old> occurs nowhere outside <new>
(a patch may wrap the original line, e.g. in an if() guard), the file is left
alone (idempotent re-run, prints "already patched"). If <new> is present but
<old> also survives elsewhere the entry fails: <new> occurring by chance would
otherwise hide an unpatched site. Otherwise <old> must occur in the file
exactly once and is replaced with <new> — zero or multiple occurrences fails
loudly with the count, since that means the upstream pin moved and the patch
must be revisited. All entries are attempted; the script exits non-zero if any
entry failed.
