# family runs on a GPU tier until the fleet validates that family on that lane, and these
# four are deliberately absent from catalog.py's _TTS_TIER_OVERRIDES).
#
# (family, env var, model dir, text, language, expected rate, needs a reference clip).
# The text is in a language the family actually covers — irodori_tts is Japanese-only, and
# for index_tts2 the language is what picks its <|lang|> prefix (left unset its tokenizer
# guesses "zh for Han text, else en"). index_tts2 is the one family whose reference clip is
# MANDATORY ("IndexTTS2 request requires --voice-ref or voice.speaker.audio"), and a clone
# reference has to be real speech, so — exactly like the GPU runner below — supertonic
# synthesizes one on the CPU device first rather than passing a sine wave off as a voice.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TTS on a real GPU device.
#
# Every TTS test above pins the CPU device on purpose (R19). This one is the opposite gate,
# and it exists because a green suite is not evidence a GPU lane works: the slice-4
# mac-arm64/metal lane shipped a wheel while three of the five families aborted the process
# on Metal, precisely because nothing here ever placed a TTS session on a Metal device
# (.superpowers/metal-tts-validation.md §1, .superpowers/metal-fix-experiments.md §1).
#
# Gating, four independent conditions so the test disappears where it cannot mean anything:
#   - SK_TEST_TTS_GPU=1 (opt-in: this loads models onto a GPU, which a plain dev run
#     of the binding tests should not do behind the developer's back);
#   - the case's own model dir — SK_TEST_TTS_<FAMILY>_DIR for the default rung, or
#     SK_TEST_TTS_<FAMILY>_BF16_DIR for the bf16 one (see GPU_TTS_BF16_ENV below), same
#     pattern as the CPU tests above — CI caches only supertonic and moss at the default
#     rung and no bf16 at all, so everything else simply skips there;
#   - devices() reporting a non-CPU device at all. The Linux/Windows CI runners are
#     headless with no Vulkan device, so they skip;
#   - the device not being a PARAVIRTUAL one. The mac-arm64 runner does report a Metal
#     device, but GitHub's macos-14 arm64 host is a VM whose GPU is "Apple Paravirtual
#     device" — it lacks has_simdgroup_reduction, so ggml refuses NORM/RMS_NORM/ARGMAX
#     and every family aborts there regardless of the code under test (ruling R36;
#     catalog.py's _TTS_TIER_OVERRIDES comment has the full reasoning). CI's Metal lane
#     therefore reports "skipped" here rather than a pass or a failure that would say
#     nothing about real Apple silicon; Metal is validated on real hardware (M4) instead,
#     and planner._tier_available refuses gpu-metal on that same description in production.
#
# One subprocess per case. A backend that lacks a kernel does not raise: ggml logs
# "unsupported op '<OP>'" and calls GGML_ABORT, i.e. SIGABRT of the whole process, so an
# in-process failure would take the pytest session with it and report nothing. The child
# registers NO log sink, exactly like the rest of this file — the abort line reaching its
# stderr is sk_common.cpp's warn/error fallback doing its job, and that fallback is the only
# reason the assertion below can name the missing op instead of an anonymous exit −6.
#
# The bar is deliberately model-free: non-empty audio of a sane duration. Intelligibility is
# the TTS->ASR loopback's job (sidecar/tests/test_tts_engine.py); pulling whisper in here
# would make a TTS backend gate depend on an ASR model being present too.

TTS_GPU = os.environ.get("SK_TEST_TTS_GPU") == "1"

GPU_TTS_MIN_PEAK = 0.01          # an all-zeros buffer of the right length must not pass

# family -> (env var name, model dir, preset or None, clones?, max seconds, text, language).
# supertonic and pocket_tts select a named preset; moss_tts_nano, voxcpm1, voxcpm2 and
# irodori_tts have a usable built-in voice; qwen3_tts (base checkpoint), omnivoice and
# index_tts2 are clone-only, so the child synthesizes its own reference clip with supertonic
# on the CPU device first and clones it with that clip's exact text (qwen3_tts and omnivoice
# additionally require that transcript; index_tts2 only needs the clip).
#
# text/language are per family because irodori_tts is Japanese-only and index_tts2 picks its
# <|lang|> prefix from the language; everything else uses the shared English sentence.
#
# The max-duration bar is 30s (a generous "did not run away" bound) except for
# moss_tts_nano, where 10s is a real signal: ruling R23 switched that family to sampled
# decode precisely because greedy argmax never reaches its end-of-content token and runs to
# audio.cpp's 300-frame / 24.000s max_new_frames cap. A ~24s clip for this one sentence is
# that cap's signature, so the tighter bound catches a backend on which the stop decision
# stops working — same threshold the CPU test above uses.
#
# The four 2026-09-03 families are cpu-only in production (they are absent from catalog.py's
# _TTS_TIER_OVERRIDES). They are listed here anyway so the fleet run that would earn them a
# GPU tier is one env var away, exactly as it was for the original five.

# The dirs above hold the DEFAULT rung — the catalog's `default_quant`, which is
# what every fleet validation so far loaded (q8_0 everywhere, f16 for supertonic).
# That is NOT what a GPU machine actually resolves: `_llamacpp_variant_row` picks
# the LARGEST quant that fits the device budget, so planner `auto` and the
# renderer's "recommended" rung on any real GPU box (CUDA_12GB/CUDA_24GB/
# APPLE_SILICON in sidecar/tests/test_characterization.py) is the BF16 one for
# every family that ships it. BF16 is a distinct tensor type with its own kernel
# coverage per backend, so a green q8_0 run says nothing about it — hence this
# second dimension, pointed at a parallel tree of BF16 checkpoints:
#
#   SK_TEST_TTS_<FAMILY>_BF16_DIR=<dir holding that family's *-bf16.gguf>
#
# Unset => that (family, bf16) case skips, exactly like the default rung's own
# dir does. supertonic has no entry at all: audio.cpp ships only F16 for it (its
# Q8_0/BF16 conversions are upstream-unresolved — see catalog.py's row comment),
# so its single rung is already the "default" case above and a bf16 case would be
# a permanently-skipping placeholder for a file that does not exist.
#
# voxcpm2 is here for the same reason the original four are: it ships voxcpm2-bf16.gguf, so
# on any GPU box with the budget for it that is the rung `_llamacpp_variant_row` actually
# resolves, and leaving it out reported a false "ships no bf16 rung" for the exact rung a
# user would run.
#
# voxcpm1, irodori_tts and index_tts2 have no entry, but only voxcpm1's absence means what
# this table says: audio.cpp ships ONE file for it. irodori_tts and index_tts2 DO ship a
# larger alt rung — an F16 one, not BF16 — which this bf16-shaped table cannot express. The
# `quant` parametrization is "default | bf16", so their f16 alts are simply not covered by
# this gate; covering them needs a per-family alt-rung dimension, not another entry here.
