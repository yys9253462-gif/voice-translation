"""audio.cpp TTS parity gate (spec §9.2): the OFFICIAL, unpatched `audiocpp_cli` (built by
build_reference_cli.sh from the same vendored source with its OWN fork ggml) versus
`libsokuji_native`'s `sk_tts` (upstream ggml + the audiocpp_compat.h shim), compared on CPU
within a ±1-LSB (16-bit PCM) tolerance.

Round 2 / ledger ruling R10(s4): a full numeric investigation
(.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-31-sidecar-ggml-only-slice4-tts/moss-divergence-investigation.md)
found that audio.cpp's forked ggml 0.12.0 has a real bug — `ggml_vec_dot_f32`'s SVE
tail-lane handling (`svmad_f32_m` instead of `svmla_f32_m`) silently corrupts F32 matmul
accumulators whenever the reduction length isn't a multiple of 4 AND an SVE-capable CPU
module is selected. Our upstream ggml 0.22.0 has the fix and is correct. On any SVE-capable
aarch64 box (this one included), the OFFICIAL reference binary is therefore itself numerically
broken for some shapes — comparing sample-exact against it conflates "the ggml swap changed
behavior" with "the official binary's own arithmetic is wrong for this input." Two
consequences, both implemented below:

1. Both sides run with the three SVE-capable CPU modules excluded (see SVE_CPU_MODULES) —
   this makes moss_tts_nano agree to ≤1 LSB end-to-end (investigation's own confirmation).
   Comparing SVE-vs-non-SVE would reintroduce exactly the drift this is trying to eliminate,
   so BOTH sides get the same treatment, not just the reference.
2. The gate itself moved from `--exact` to a ±1-LSB tolerance (MAX_ABS_TOLERANCE below).
   Cross-ggml-version sample-exactness was never a meaningful bar — different minor versions
   of the SAME correct algorithm are allowed to round differently in the last bit; ≤1 LSB of
   16-bit PCM is the achievable, meaningful invariant. The SVE story above is the case study
   that proves the distinction matters: two builds can each be internally correct and still
   not agree to the last float32 ULP.

Round 3 / rulings R11 and R12
(.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-31-sidecar-ggml-only-slice4-tts/residuals-investigation.md) closed
the two residuals round 2 left, in opposite directions — which is why the gate is no longer
one uniform tolerance:

3. R11, supertonic: a REAL divergence on our side. Upstream ggml's conv constructors
   materialise their im2col buffer in F16 where audio.cpp's fork uses the kernel's dtype,
   so our build ran supertonic's duration predictor at half precision and mispredicted its
   own output length by 14 samples. native/src/audiocpp_compat.h now shims the four conv
   entry points; the case is sample-exact and gated with _compare_exact, NOT the tolerance.
   Precision-losing bugs of this shape hide inside a tolerance band — so where exactness is
   provably achievable, this file demands it.
4. R12, moss_clone: NOT a divergence anyone can fix. A single fp16 GELU lookup-table entry
   rounds differently between the two ggml versions, and MOSS's 4800 argmax decisions turn
   that one ULP into a different (equally valid) trajectory from frame 1. Permanently
   xfailed; see the case for the full chain. Waveform parity is the wrong invariant for a
   chaotic decoder, and no tolerance can distinguish it from a real break.

Round 4 / ruling R23 (jiangzhuo 2026-09-01, .superpowers/moss-eoc-verdict.md): moss_tts_nano
switched from greedy to SAMPLED decode in production (native/src/sk_tts.cpp's `sample_decode`
family flag) because greedy argmax never reaches this checkpoint's own end-of-content token
for ordinary input — it runs to audio.cpp's 300-frame/24.000s `max_new_frames` cap instead
(measured once, E1; corroborated by the pre-existing parity baseline's own greedy-decode
runaway), while sampling reaches real EOC in 2.6-3.7s (measured 3/3, E2a/b/c). Seed stays fixed
at "0" either way, so both `test_moss_text_only` and `test_moss_clone` below now pass
`--request-option do_sample=true` to the reference CLI to match what the candidate binding
does internally. Measured directly for this file's two fixed test inputs: both cases
reproduce BIT-EXACT (max_abs=0.0) and repeatably across reruns — R12's argmax-tie fragility
does not reproduce for these specific inputs under sampling. It is NOT eliminated as a class,
though: the same investigation found a different sentence against the same voice-clone
reference diverges into a different frame count entirely under sampling too (chaotic
autoregressive amplification doesn't care whether the fragile decision was an argmax tie or
a sampled draw). `test_moss_clone` therefore keeps its existing soft xfail-on-failure shape
(assert only if the comparison actually fails) with its reason string updated to describe
sampling-draw amplification rather than argmax-tie amplification — not flipped to a hard
assert, since a clean pass on today's fixed input is not evidence the class of risk is gone.

Every case is gated on two independent things, so each one skips on its own:
  - the reference CLI existing at all (native/tests/parity/build_reference_cli.sh must have
    been run first — this file never builds it itself: that is a ~15 minute, network-using
    step that has no place inside an ordinary pytest run);
  - the family's model directory env var (SK_TEST_TTS_<FAMILY>_DIR) being set, mirroring
    native/python/tests/test_sokuji_native.py's needs_tts_* pattern.

Determinism: both sides fix seed=0 — the CLI explicitly (`--seed 0`), our binding always
internally (R7, native/README.md's TTS section). do_sample is do_sample=false on both sides
for every family EXCEPT moss_tts_nano, which is do_sample=true on both sides (Ruling R23,
Round 4 above) — the CLI's `--request-option do_sample=...` is set per-case below to match
whichever mode the candidate binding will use for that family, never mixed across sides.
Both sides are pinned to the SAME thread count (THREADS
below) via `--threads` on the CLI and `sokuji_native.init(n_threads=...)` on the binding —
ggml's CPU matmul reduction order (and therefore floating-point rounding) is thread-count
dependent, so a mismatch here would be indistinguishable from a genuine backend divergence.

Candidate isolation: the candidate side now runs in its OWN subprocess (see
_CANDIDATE_RUNNER/_run_candidate), one per test, with SOKUJI_NATIVE_DIR pointed at the SVE-free
module directory ONLY for that subprocess's environment. This is not just tidiness:
sokuji_native.native_dir() is read once and cached for the life of a process
(native/python/sokuji_native/__init__.py's `_load()`), so mutating this test's own os.environ
would leak the SVE-free override into any other test module sharing the same pytest session
(e.g. native/python/tests/test_sokuji_native.py, which must keep exercising the real staged
build, SVE and all) — a subprocess is the only way to give the candidate its own environment
without that risk. It also sidesteps the old "only the FIRST sokuji_native.init() call's
n_threads takes effect" caveat: each test's candidate now gets a fresh process.

WAV encoding: the CLI's `--out` always writes 16-bit PCM via audio.cpp's own
`engine::audio::write_pcm16_wav` (clamp to [-1, 1], `lrint(sample * 32767.0f)`, report §7). The
candidate subprocess's own quantization (inlined in _CANDIDATE_RUNNER) replicates that exact
formula — clamp, ×32767.0 in float32, round-to-nearest-even — so a quantizer mismatch can never
masquerade as a parity failure on top of the ±1-LSB tolerance this round already added.

    defeat this (it would still search the ORIGINAL, SVE-including directory). Copying
    uniformly for both sides (rather than symlinking the ones that could tolerate it) keeps
    this one mechanism simple.

    2026-09-02 incident: this cache used to live at one FIXED path per caller (e.g.
    CACHE_DIR / "sokuji-native-nosve"), refreshed only when the source key file's mtime was
    `>=` the cached copy's mtime. A scratch build under a different source directory, with a
    newer libsokuji_native.so, silently repopulated that shared fixed path (leaving a foreign
    libggml-vulkan.so behind too) — every later parity run against the real staged build then
    used that foreign build without any signal, producing two spurious failures. Keying the
    cache subdir by the source directory's own path makes two different sources physically
    unable to land in the same slot, and wiping the slot before recopying means a refresh can
    never leave a stale foreign file behind either.

    FRESHNESS covers the WHOLE copied set, not just `key_file`. The staged tree is a
    libsokuji_native plus a dozen ggml modules that ggml `dlopen`s at runtime by directory
    search, so a rebuild that changes only `libggml-cpu-armv8.2_2.so` (or drops a module, or
    adds one) changes what the parity run actually executes while leaving
    libsokuji_native.so untouched — and a key_file-only check would happily reuse the stale
    copy. The signature below is (name, size, mtime) for every file the copy contains,
    computed the SAME way on both sides (shutil.copy2 preserves both), so it catches an
    added file, a removed file, a resized file, and a same-size rewrite whose mtime is
    older than some other file's in the directory — none of which an aggregate

    # quantization error). Neither ggml is more correct, and the two versions' source for both
    # the GELU formula and the table build is identical. Under GREEDY decode that 3.05e-05
    # landed in layer 4 of the global transformer at decode step 1, reached ~1.2e-2 in the
    # hidden by layer 11, and flipped 4 of the 16 codebook argmax decisions in frame 1

    # decision was an argmax tie or a sampled draw. This is therefore still NOT waivable by
