"""Boot-smoke one packed sidecar bundle (slice 6 Task 4, workflow half).

Run by the HOST python that built/packed the archive (needs the `zstandard`
package — every bundle-build CI job already does `pip install zstandard`
before calling build-sidecar-bundle.py) — NOT the bundle's own embedded
interpreter, since unpacking has to happen before that interpreter exists on
disk. This script:

  1. Finds the archive scripts/build-sidecar-bundle.py just produced for one
     SKU (joining split `.tar.zst.001/.002/...` parts when present, exactly
     like the packer's PART_LIMIT splitting), and unpacks it into a scratch
     dir (children at root: `python/`, `app/`, `bundle.json` — see that
     script's `pack_zst`).
  2. Re-execs the BUNDLE'S OWN embedded interpreter (the thing a real
     install actually runs — `python/python.exe` on Windows, otherwise
     `python/bin/python3`) to prove:
       (a) `import sokuji_sidecar` succeeds and report its on-disk entry
           point.
       (b) sokuji_native is importable and reports version()/
           engine_versions(). `requirements.txt` pins the five
           `sokuji-native` release wheels by platform marker (since
           sidecar-v0.2.0), so a real, non-hollow `sokuji_native` is the
           expected state of every bundle — a missing one is a bug, not
           an expected condition. By default a missing `sokuji_native` is
           only a WARN (native.py still imports it lazily on first use —
           see its module docstring — so the sidecar itself boots without
           it); pass --require-native, or set
           SIDECAR_SMOKE_REQUIRE_NATIVE=1 (what CI's `sidecar-bundles.yml`
           runs with), to turn a missing sokuji_native into a hard
           failure instead.
       (c) `python -m sokuji_sidecar` boots to its `{"port": n}` handshake
           line. There is no --version/--help entrypoint (see __main__.py)
           to probe instead, so this full boot is the floor — and it is
           strictly stronger evidence than an import-only check. This is
           exactly what the linux-arm64 CI job already did before Task 4;
           this script generalizes that one job's inline step to all five
           SKUs so every bundle-build job can call it identically.

Usage:
    python scripts/sidecar-bundle-smoke.py --sku linux-arm64 --bundles-dir out/bundles
    python scripts/sidecar-bundle-smoke.py --sku linux-x64 --bundles-dir out/bundles --require-native

Exit 0 on success. A missing sokuji_native is a hard failure when
--require-native / SIDECAR_SMOKE_REQUIRE_NATIVE is set (CI's default). The
env var is on only for "1", "true" or "yes" (case-insensitive); anything
else — including "0", "" or unset — is off. Otherwise a missing
sokuji_native is only a warning. Exit 1 with a clear message on any other
real failure. No model downloads; both checks are bounded well under a
minute combined.
