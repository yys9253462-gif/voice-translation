"""Deployment planner: given a Machine and a catalog model, decide the ordered
list of Plans (best first, CPU floor last) — tier gating, quant/variant
picking, platform filtering. No hardware probing, no downloads, no model
loading, and NO runtime import of accel.py at all: every environment/I-O fact
this module needs — the current OS platform tag, the RTF/tps bench cache,
which quants are already downloaded locally, how to estimate a deployment's
VRAM footprint, and whether a compute-type's runtime is importable — arrives
as a plain parameter or an injected callable, supplied by whichever caller
already did that I/O. That makes every function here table-testable with
plain values; no monkeypatching required.

accel.py (the Loader) owns hardware probing, downloads, and model loading. It
imports this module at its own module scope and re-exposes `resolve`,
`resolve_translate`, `resolve_tts`, `select_variant`, `_llamacpp_variant_row`,
and `resolve_deployments` as thin Loader-wrapper functions of the same name
and public call signature the frozen characterisation suite and the engines
already depend on: each wrapper fetches its own I/O — calling
`current_platform()`/`bench_load()`/`probe()`/`_downloaded_quants()`/
`_est_bytes()`/`_format_ready()` as bare module-global names in accel.py, so
tests that do `monkeypatch.setattr(accel, "<name>", ...)` keep observing
them — and hands the results to the pure function here as parameters.
Dependency direction is strictly one-way: accel imports planner, planner
never imports accel."""
