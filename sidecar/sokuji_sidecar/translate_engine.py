    """Free this connection's translate model when the connection closes.

    M5 twin (see tts_engine.py's _tts_teardown docstring for the full trace of
    the race this guards -- ledgered against this exact line, tts_engine.py's own
    _h_tts_init comment history, and .superpowers/slice5-surface-inventory.md
    §10(a)): TranslateEngine.init() below also calls close() on entry for VRAM
    hygiene; `generation` is the engine's generation token captured by
    _h_translate_init at the time IT finished loading, and a stale teardown from
    an earlier init (superseded by a fresher one since) no-ops instead of tearing
    down the newer, currently-live backend. generation=None (every pre-M5 direct
    call) disables the check, matching the old unconditional-close behavior.

    Disconnect-triggered cancel (slice-5 task 5; ground truth
    .superpowers/slice5-surface-inventory.md §10(b) -- the translate-side twin of
    tts_engine._tts_teardown's own CQ-4 fix): cancel the backend's own in-flight
    generation BEFORE closing the engine. close() -> backend.unload() cancels and
    joins every outstanding worker itself (translate_backend.py's I3 twin), but
    reaching into cancel_active() first signals it to stop as early as possible
    rather than relying solely on unload()'s own (also correct, but later)
    cancel+join. No new wire message this slice (ruling R20): a disconnected
    client's generation is what gets cancelled, never a client-sent
    translate_cancel.

    CORRECTION (ruling R26, fix round 1): this closure only runs from
    server._conn's on_close list, which fires once _conn's own
    `async for raw in ws:` loop returns -- i.e. AFTER whatever handler call
    was in flight when the connection closed already finished. Confirmed live
    by the round-1 reviewer: it does NOT fire mid-flight for a disconnect
    racing THIS connection's own currently-running translate(), because
    server.py's per-connection dispatch is serial (the handler is awaited
    inline, not scheduled as a background task). This function still matters
    -- a stale/superseded engine close, and a same-connection disconnect
    noticed at the next message -- but the mid-flight race is instead handled
    by _h_translate itself (see its docstring), which races the executor
    future against conn.wait_closed() directly and calls cancel_active() the
    moment the close-waiter wins, without ever needing this closure to run."""

    """Ruling R26 (ground truth .superpowers/slice5-surface-inventory.md
    §10(b)): a disconnect must be able to cancel a generation THIS coroutine
    is still awaiting, not merely one server._conn notices at its next
    iteration. server._conn's `async for raw in ws:` loop awaits this handler
    call inline and serially -- it cannot notice `conn.on_close()`-registered
    cleanups (see _translate_teardown) until this coroutine RETURNS, by which
    point a plain `await loop.run_in_executor(...)` would already have let the
    generation run to completion for a client that is long gone.

    Fix: race the executor future against `conn.wait_closed()` (server.Conn;
    see its own docstring for why that resolves independent of _conn's
    recv() loop) via asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED). If the close-waiter wins,
    server._conn's per-connection serialization guarantees THIS CONNECTION has
    at most one translate() in flight at a time, so eng.cancel_active() targets
    an in-flight call that is either ours or -- see M-3 correction below --
    already finished/superseded; the cancelled (or already-done) call still
    has to be awaited to completion (its worker thread must actually exit --
    translate_backend.py's cb-False path makes that quick, within one token)
    before this coroutine returns, but the result is discarded and no reply is
    sent (`return None, None` -- server.Conn.send() is a no-op for that, and
    there is nothing left to reply to). If the executor future wins (the
    overwhelmingly common case), the close-waiter task is cancelled so it
    doesn't leak, and dispatch proceeds exactly as before this fix.

    CORRECTION (ruling M-3, final fix wave): the paragraph above used to claim
    "this connection is the ONLY caller that can be running a translate() on
    it right now" -- true PER-CONNECTION (server._conn's serial dispatch means
    THIS connection can never have two translate() calls in flight at once),
    but false PER-PROCESS. `state["translate_engine"]` is a process-wide
    singleton (`__main__.py`'s construction, shared by every connection the
    sidecar serves, exactly like `state["tts_engine"]` -- ground truth
    .superpowers/slice5-surface-inventory.md §10(c)/M2, "cross-conn cancel
    crosstalk -- singleton evicts"), so a SECOND connection can be concurrently
    running its own translate() against that same shared `self._backend`
    whenever both connections are using an already-loaded model without an
    intervening translate_init. `eng.cancel_active()` -> `backend.cancel()`
    targets `self._workers[-1]` -- the MOST RECENTLY STARTED call across every
    connection sharing that backend, not "our own" by identity -- so under
    that concurrent-connection condition this can cancel a DIFFERENT
    connection's in-flight generation instead of (or as well as) this one's
    own. This is the identical root cause and shape as M2, accepted there as
    a "larger design question" needing a per-connection engine or an explicit
    ownership token (ground truth, same section) rather than a one-liner fix;
    not fixed here for the same reason. unload()'s own cancel-everything
    backstop (translate_backend.py's I-1 fix) still guarantees no worker is
    ever freed out from under a live native call regardless of which
    connection's tail got mistargeted -- only the CHOICE of which in-flight
    call gets cancelled early is what this correction narrows."""
