"""Native TTS backend (spec §5.3/§5.5): sokuji_native's TtsModel wraps audio.cpp's
five families in-process (moss_tts_nano, qwen3_tts, omnivoice, pocket_tts,
supertonic). One class covers every family: capability differences (streaming vs
offline, clones or not, native sample rate) are read off the loaded model's
`.capabilities` once, at load(), and stored as instance attributes that shadow the
class defaults — tts_engine reads STREAMING/CLONES/sample_rate per instance, exactly
so a single `native_tts` NAME can serve all five families. Which family loads is
picked by the catalog card via PlanConfig.tts_family (sk_tts_load's required
family_hint); PlanConfig.tts_language is pocket_tts's load-time language package
("english", ...), ignored by every other family.

model_ref is the artifact "org/repo/<dir>/<file>.gguf" the catalog resolves to. The
files a family ships besides the gguf (voice presets, embeddings, ...) live under the
SAME <dir> in its HF repo, so load() resolves a SCOPED local snapshot — only that one
directory, not the whole repo — via `allow_patterns=[f"{dir}/*"]`.

Ruling R18(s4) — SUPERSEDES the prior "no hard-links" ruling: the gguf (and, for
pocket_tts, its embeddings/*.safetensors sidecar) are hard-link-staged into a small
sokuji-owned tree under the SAME cache root before ever reaching the native layer (see
_stage_for_native()). The prior ruling's own reasoning — "HF's local cache already
links snapshot files back to the shared blob store, no additional staging is needed" —
is still correct about directory LAYOUT (pocket_tts's embeddings/ sits correctly next
to its gguf either way); it just never anticipated audio.cpp's own model loader
canonicalizing the path before sniffing its format by extension. HF's real
snapshot_download() snapshot entries are SYMLINKS into a content-addressed blob store
(no `.gguf`/`.safetensors` extension on the blob itself); audio.cpp's vendored
prepare_model_directory() (`_deps/audiocpp-src/src/framework/assets/tensor_source.cpp`)
calls `std::filesystem::weakly_canonical()` on that symlinked path before handing it to
open_tensor_source(), which dispatches purely on `path.extension()` — for a path that
exists in full, weakly_canonical() behaves like canonical() and fully resolves the
symlink down to the extensionless blob, so the extension check always fails
("unsupported tensor source format"). Live-verified against every native_tts family
this reaches (not just pocket-tts-en); ASR (transcribe.cpp) is unaffected by the
identical symlinked-cache shape, so this is specific to audio.cpp's own loader.
A HARD link is a second directory entry for the SAME inode, not a symlink, and is
therefore NOT resolved by weakly_canonical() — the staged path keeps its real
extension all the way through canonicalization, with no copy of the (up to several-GB)
weight data. See final-fixwave-report.md's "Round 2: R18" section for the full trace.

generate_stream() bridges sokuji_native's synth() callback — invoked on the CALLING
thread, from C, once per pulled chunk — into a Python generator. A generator cannot
itself be resumed from inside a foreign callback, so a worker thread runs the
blocking synth() call and feeds a queue.Queue; the generator's own thread just drains
that queue. cancel() sets a threading.Event the callback checks before queuing each
chunk — that closes the loop all the way to the native session (sk_tts_synth's
on_audio returning false between chunks cancels there, per sk_tts.cpp), which is what
makes a superseding tts_generate or an explicit tts_cancel actually stop generation
instead of merely detaching the old asyncio Task (tts_engine.py defect 2).

generate_stream() itself is a PLAIN function, not a generator: it creates the queue,
the cancel Event, and the worker thread -- and registers the (thread, event) pair in
self._workers -- EAGERLY, before returning, then hands back a small inner generator
that only drains the queue. If generate_stream() were itself the generator (the
`yield` inside its own body), none of that setup would run until the caller's first
next()/iteration -- a cancel() called in the window between create_task() and the
first poll would target whatever was registered from a PRIOR stream (or nothing) and
be silently lost (review round 1, CQ-6).

self._workers is a LIST of every (thread, event) pair whose stream hasn't finished
self-cleanup yet, not a single slot -- a single slot let a SUPERSEDED stream's worker
become an orphan invisible to unload(): tts_generate's supersede path cancels the
CURRENT stream and starts a new one without waiting for the old one to actually stop,
so the old worker can still be inside self._model.synth(...) when the new stream
overwrites what unload() would join. unload() must therefore join EVERY outstanding
worker, not just the most recent (review round 2). cancel() still only ever needs to
target the most recently started entry: tts_engine's supersede path always calls
cancel_active() BEFORE starting the new stream (never after), so at the moment
cancel() reads self._workers[-1] it can only be the stream actually being superseded
-- the new one hasn't registered yet.

A real (non-cancelled) synth() failure is re-raised out of the drain generator, not
swallowed -- tts_engine's own `for chunk in generate_stream(...)` loop already wraps
that iteration in a try/except that turns any raised exception into an "error" push
on the wire; swallowing it here would instead surface as a truncated stream ending in
a normal tts_done (review round 1, CQ-2). A cancelled synth's own exception (raised
because on_chunk returned False) IS still swallowed -- that is our own cancellation
taking effect, not a failure.

The drain generator wraps its loop in try/finally: cancelled.set(), so a consumer
that abandons it early (break, .close(), garbage collection) raises GeneratorExit at
the suspended yield, which the finally block turns into the same cancellation any
other stop takes -- otherwise the worker thread and its native synth() call would run
to completion unobserved (review round 1, CQ-3).

Fix wave (2026-09-01), three more defects:

I3 -- self._workers ALSO tracks a one-shot generate() while it is inside
self._model.synth(...), not just streaming workers: entry is (threading.current_thread(),
None) -- registered on entry, deregistered on exit via try/finally, no cancel Event
needed because an offline family cannot be interrupted mid-run anyway (tts_engine.py's
own comment on this). Before this fix, unload() only joined streaming workers, so a
one-shot generate() running on another executor thread could still be mid-sk_tts_synth
when unload() nulled the model handle and freed it underneath it -- a native
use-after-free. unload()'s existing cancel-then-join loop already tolerates a None
event (skips the .set()) and joins the thread like any other entry, so one-shot and
streaming workers share one registry and one shared deadline. cancel() also tolerates a
None event (a one-shot at self._workers[-1] makes cancel() a harmless no-op, matching
"one-shot generation is never cancelled").

Final fix wave (2026-09-01), ruling I-1 -- I3's fix above registered the one-shot
entry as (threading.current_thread(), None) and had unload() call
thread.join(timeout=...) on it, exactly the defect translate_backend.py's
translate() had (see that module's own "Final fix wave" paragraph for the full
trace, which applies identically here). In production generate() always runs
via tts_engine's `loop.run_in_executor(None, ...)` -- a ThreadPoolExecutor
worker that returns to the pool, IDLE, once generate() returns, rather than
terminating -- so thread.join() burned the FULL 10s deadline on every
unload(), whether or not generate() had already finished, stalling the event
loop and hollowing the very UAF backstop the deadline exists to enforce.
Fixed the same way as translate_backend.py: the one-shot entry now carries a
`done` Event (set in generate()'s own finally, once self._model.synth(...)
has actually returned) instead of a thread reference, and unload() waits on
that instead of joining. generate_stream()'s STREAMING entries are UNCHANGED
and still correct as-is -- `thread` there is a real, dedicated
threading.Thread this module itself creates and starts (see
generate_stream()'s own docstring below), which DOES terminate on its own
once its target function returns; joining it was never the bug.
self._workers now holds a 3-tuple, (thread, cancel, done), so unload()'s
single loop can tell the two shapes apart: a STREAMING entry has a real
thread (and no done Event) and gets joined; a ONE-SHOT entry has thread=None
(and no cancel Event) and gets waited on via its done Event instead.

R16 -- qwen3_tts and omnivoice have NO usable default voice: a synth() attempted with
neither set_voice() nor set_builtin_voice() called first fails deep inside audio.cpp
with a none-too-friendly, native-layer-specific message (live-verified,
task-7-report.md §3: "Qwen3 base TTS requires voice clone reference audio").
_ensure_voice_ready() raises a clear, family-named BackendLoadError here, BEFORE ever
reaching the native layer, so the wire error is deterministic and readable regardless
of what audio.cpp happens to throw that day. moss_tts_nano also reports CLONES=True
but is NOT gated -- native/tests/test_tts.cpp's own case synths before ever calling
set_voice, so a bare synth() genuinely works with no preset. pocket_tts ALSO reports
CLONES=True and was ORIGINALLY believed to be in that same "ships a working built-in
default" camp -- live-verified WRONG in slice 5b's Task 4 review round, against real
ggufs: a bare pocket_tts synth() with no preset/voice set fails, just like qwen3/
omnivoice, with its own audio.cpp message ("PocketTTS session prepare() requires a
session voice via --voice-id or --voice-ref"). pocket_tts is deliberately NOT added
to _VOICE_REQUIRED_FAMILIES for this -- that would only turn the failure into a clean
error, not make a bare synth actually work. See ruling R34 below for how load()
instead gives pocket_tts a genuinely working default voice. Summary of what a bare
generate() (no set_voice()/set_builtin_voice() ever called by the client) does today:
moss_tts_nano and supertonic synth for real with no preset; qwen3_tts/omnivoice raise
_ensure_voice_ready()'s clean BackendLoadError; pocket_tts synths for real too, but
only because load() (R34) already applied its one default preset on its behalf.

I2 -- the per-synth ACTUAL sample rate (audio.cpp's own returned rate, which can differ
from the family's advertised caps.sample_rate) is now forwarded end-to-end instead of
discarded: generate() returns it as its own return value, and generate_stream()'s
on_chunk callback forwards it into each queued/yielded chunk. tts_engine resamples with
whichever rate accompanies each result/chunk, not the caps-table default -- the default
stays valid for planning/UI (it's what the family's own capabilities/tts_init reply
report before any synth has actually run).

Task 4 (slice 5b, 2026-09-02), ruling R33 -- W-1 (windows-vulkan-validation.md):
the FIRST synth per family on a cold GPU pays a one-time pipeline-compile cost
(moss_tts_nano measured 16.52s on Vulkan before NVIDIA's on-disk shader cache
warmed up, vs 0.63-0.73s on every later process) that a plain load() + first
real synth would otherwise hand straight to the user as extra latency on their
first utterance. load() now runs one short, discarded synth ("Warm-up.")
through the EXACT one-shot path generate() itself uses -- same self._workers
registration, same `done` Event -- right after the model and its capability
attributes are set, but ONLY when BOTH hold: the resolved device is not CPU
(CPU pays nothing extra for a first synth per W-1's own measurements, so
warming it up there would only slow down every CPU load for no benefit), and
the family is not one of _VOICE_REQUIRED_FAMILIES (qwen3_tts/omnivoice have no
usable default voice at load() time -- see R16 above -- so warming them up
would immediately hit _ensure_voice_ready()'s own guard; their first REAL
synth, which always follows a client set_voice() call, still pays the
one-time compile once, exactly as it did before this change). "the resolved
device is not CPU" is read off the SAME `device` string already passed into
this call's own native.device_for(device) lookup a few lines above (not off
the returned Device object) -- device_for() only returns successfully when
`device` names an actual device of that kind in this process, so `device` and
the resolved Device's own `.kind` are guaranteed identical at this point;
comparing the string sidesteps needing every device_for() stand-in (including
tests') to return an object shaped like a real Device. A warm-up is purely an
optimization, never a correctness requirement: _warm_up() catches everything
generate() can raise, logs it to stderr, and returns -- load() must still
succeed and hand back a backend ready to serve a (merely slower) first real
synth even if the warm-up itself failed.

Fix round 1 (2026-09-02), ruling R34 -- reviewer live-verification against real ggufs
caught Task 4's own docstring overclaiming "none of the five families requires a
preset before a plain generate()": pocket_tts's engine genuinely requires a session
voice (see R16's corrected paragraph above), so the warm-up above was a SILENT NO-OP
for pocket_tts on a GPU load -- _warm_up()'s own try/except caught the native failure
and logged it, never actually exercising (or hiding the cost of) pocket's GPU
pipeline compile. moss_tts_nano and supertonic's bare synth() calls were separately
live-verified to genuinely work with no preset. _DEFAULT_PRESET_FAMILIES =
{"pocket_tts"} names the one family whose engine needs a preset before ANY synth can
run at all, not merely the warm-up -- load() now calls
set_builtin_voice(presets()[0]) for a family in that set (pocket's own card ships a
single "alba" preset, read off presets()'s own listing -- embeddings/*.safetensors
basenames -- not hardcoded) BEFORE _warm_up() runs, and unconditionally (both CPU and
GPU loads: a bare CPU generate() was exactly as broken as a bare GPU one, so this is
a correctness fix, not warm-up-only plumbing). supertonic is deliberately NOT in this
set: its engine already has a working built-in default voice, and applying a preset
here would silently change what a bare synth's DEFAULT voice sounds like for every
caller that never asked for one. Consequence: a client that never calls set_voice()/
set_builtin_voice() on pocket_tts now gets a real, working synth (using the "alba"
preset) instead of the native session-prepare error -- previously-broken, untested
behavior that this fix makes both correct and covered.

Round 2 (2026-09-01), ruling R18 -- see the module docstring's second paragraph above
for the full defect trace. _stage_for_native() hard-links the resolved gguf (+ any
PlanConfig.tts_extra_files sidecars) into a deterministic, idempotent staging path
under the same HF cache root, keyed by (repo, snapshot revision, file's path within the
repo): re-staging over an already-correct link (same inode, checked via
os.path.samefile) is a no-op; a stale/missing/foreign entry is removed and re-created.
`source` is resolved via os.path.realpath() before linking, not trusted to os.link()'s
own `follow_symlinks` handling (live-verified platform gap: see
_stage_for_native()'s own docstring). Falls back to a real copy if os.link() fails
(EXDEV -- a filesystem boundary between the staging tree and the cache blob it links
to -- or a filesystem without hard-link support). native_models.py's delete paths
must remove a card's staged entries too (a
hard link keeps the blob's inode alive even after the HF-cache-side symlink/blob is
deleted, so "delete" would otherwise silently free nothing) -- see that module's own
_prune_staged_files()/_prune_staged_repo()."""

        tearing down the process-singleton engine while another connection's
        load() is still warming up) waits for it exactly like any other
        in-flight generate(), instead of freeing the handle out from under it.

        live-verified, a transient native error, ...) is logged to stderr and
        swallowed here -- load() must still succeed regardless.

        Accuracy note (linux-x64-vulkan-validation.md §4): the cost this hides
        is the NVIDIA driver's own on-disk pipeline/shader cache
        (`__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH`) -- a PER-MACHINE cost, not per-process
        and not per-session. Measured 2-14s cold (an empty driver cache) vs
        ~0.06-0.94s once that cache is warm, across all five families. So this
        warm-up buys the full saving only on a first-ever run on a given
        machine; on every later process (warm driver cache) it still runs, but
        it is hiding a steady-state synth (tens to hundreds of ms), not a fresh
