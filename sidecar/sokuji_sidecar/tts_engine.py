"""TTS stage: resolve the native_tts backend via accel, synthesize, and normalize
output to the renderer's Int16@24k mono contract. Process singleton, reused across
sessions; close() frees VRAM.

Three defects fixed here (spec §5.3, inventory §3):
  1. Model load/measure_rtf_tts, set_voice/set_builtin_voice, and one-shot generate()
     all ran synchronously on the single asyncio event loop this process' whole
     connection dispatch shares — every one-shot synthesis or (re)load stalled ASR/
     translate traffic on every OTHER connection too. All three now run in the
     default executor, mirroring translate_engine._h_translate's existing shape.
  2. tts_cancel only ever flipped a dict flag the STREAMING worker polled; a
     superseding tts_generate cancelled the old asyncio Task but not the executor
     thread actually running the backend's generation, so the old synthesis kept
     consuming the GPU. Both tts_cancel and a superseding tts_generate now ALSO call
     eng.cancel_active() -> backend.cancel(), which reaches the native session itself
     (see tts_backend.NativeTtsBackend.cancel). One-shot generation has no such hook:
     an offline family cannot be interrupted mid-run, so tts_cancel is a documented
     no-op while a one-shot request is in flight.
  3. _to_int16_24k_mono resampled with unantialiased linear interpolation whenever
     src_sr != target_sr (e.g. Supertonic 44100->24000). Now uses soxr, already a
     pinned dependency.
