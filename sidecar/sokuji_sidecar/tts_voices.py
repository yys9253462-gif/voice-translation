"""Built-in TTS voice listing (spec §6): a flat list of preset names, matching
sk_tts_presets'/TtsModel.presets()'s own shape -- audio.cpp publishes names only,
none of the old ONNX stack's editorial language/gender/curated metadata (any such
curation now lives, if anywhere, in the renderer).

If the requested model is the one currently loaded on the given engine, ask its
backend directly (mirrors .presets() on the live handle) -- always authoritative
when available. Otherwise, a load-free path serves what it can without a
session: supertonic's ten presets (F1-F5/M1-M5) are baked INTO the GGUF itself
(registry.inspect().discovered_configs, not a sibling directory the downloaded
snapshot ships separately -- see native/README.md's "GGUF-embedded sidecars"
note and native/tests/test_tts.cpp's own CTest, which enumerates exactly this
list), so they are hardcoded here (fix round 1, CQ-4) -- mirroring the old ONNX
SupertonicBackend's own hardcoded list, which likewise needed no download.
pocket_tts ships a REAL sibling `embeddings/*.safetensors` directory in its HF
snapshot, read straight off disk. Every other family -- moss_tts_nano, qwen3_tts,
omnivoice, and the 2026-09-03 batch (voxcpm1, voxcpm2, irodori_tts, index_tts2,
none of which audio.cpp exposes built-in voices for) -- has no load-free listing
(voice cloning only, or no bundled catalogue) and reports []."""
