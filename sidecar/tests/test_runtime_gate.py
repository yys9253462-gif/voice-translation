"""Verification gate (spec §9.3/§11): no heavyweight legacy-runtime import may
reappear anywhere under sokuji_sidecar/, and requirements.txt stays pinned to
its end state: 7 PyPI packages + 5 sokuji-native release-wheel URL lines (one
per SKU, pinned to the native-v1.0.1 GitHub Release, gated by sys_platform/
platform_machine markers). AST-based so comments/docstrings mentioning the
names stay allowed."""

# gone in slice 2: ASR runs through sokuji_native. gone in slice 3: translation
# runs through sokuji_native too — the D3 CTranslate2/Opus-MT adoption is over,
# its dependency and the ct2_opus_translate/llamacpp_* backends are deleted.
# gone in slice 4: TTS runs through sokuji_native too — sherpa_onnx (the
# sherpa_tts backend), mlx_audio (the mlx_audio_tts backend),
# sentencepiece/tokenizers (MOSS's ORT runtime / the deleted
# qwen_tokenizer.py), and the GPT-SoVITS G2P stack's dependencies
# (jieba/pypinyin/g2pM/nltk/pyopenjtalk) are all freed along with the nine
# ONNX/sherpa/MLX TTS backends (fix round 1: mlx_audio/sentencepiece/
# tokenizers were a review-flagged gap in the original list). gone in slice 5:
# onnxruntime — every SKU's requirements file is now just the shared base
# (sidecar/requirements.txt); ASR, translation, and TTS all run through
# sokuji_native, so no backend needs an ONNX runtime anymore.
# M-2 (final fix wave): spec §9.3 bans the whole `mlx*` family, not just
# `mlx_audio` — bare `import mlx.core` (Apple's own MLX framework, distinct
# from the mlx_audio TTS wrapper) previously passed this gate uncaught.
