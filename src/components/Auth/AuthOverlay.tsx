/**
 * Authentication, rendered over the app rather than in place of it.
 *
 * SignIn, SignUp and ForgotPassword used to be siblings of Home in the router.
 * Navigating to one unmounted the entire tree — UserProfileProvider,
 * TourProvider, SettingsInitializer, MainLayout, MainPanel — and took any
 * running translation session with it, before the user had typed a character.
 * Signing in successfully then mounted all of it again from scratch.
 *
 * As an overlay, Home never unmounts, and the user keeps sight of whatever they
 * were configuring when they reached for the account.
