/**
 * "Split did not take effect" — the decision, as a pure function.
 *
 * A degraded split session looks healthy from the outside: the mode picker
 * still reads Both, the countdown still runs, and the only residual signal is
 * a missing participant waveform, which exists in ADVANCED UI mode only. The
 * session is genuinely fine to continue (decision 4: a participant leg that
 * never comes up does not block the session) — it is just one-way, and the
 * user has no way to know. Split is BUDGETED at roughly twice shared's rate
 * (two transcription streams instead of one), so a degraded split session
 * spends the allowance — and the visible countdown — at the split rate while
 * delivering one direction. The loss is session TIME rather than money: the
 * charge is provider cost × K per usage log, and a leg that never opened a
 * socket produces neither. A user who asked for split is owed the truth when
 * it did not happen.
 *
 * Four paths in connectConversation can leave a split session one-way, and
 * all four feed this:
 *   1. loopback permission denied (Electron whole-system capture)
 *   2. createParticipantSessionConfig() returning null
 *   3. the general participant catch (a connect failure, a recorder failure,
 *      or the acquire-throw sibling that used to be console-only)
 *   4. the leg wiring up fine and its stream dying before the session goes
 *      active — the one path where nothing else in MainPanel reacts at all,
 *      because the leg's onClose early-returns while `!isSessionActive`
 *
 * The first three are known by the time connectConversation reaches its
 * resolve call. The fourth is a fact that ARRIVES, so it is recorded where it
 * happens and read there; see `participantStreamEnded` below.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free on purpose (no React, no i18n, no client imports) so
 * it can be unit-tested without a rendering harness — the same rule
 * resolveVoicePrepOutcome follows.
 */

/**
 * Every way a split session can end up one-way. Declared as a value, not just
 * a union, so the enumerations in the tests are exhaustive by construction —

/**
 * Should the "one-way only" indicator be shown, and for what reason?
 *
 * `participantChannelStarted` is the end-to-end WIRING flag — the participant
 * client connected AND its recorder was wired. It mirrors
 * setParticipantChannelActive(true)'s own contract, and it is deliberately not
 * read as "the leg works": for Soniox, `connect()` resolves inside `ws.onopen`,
 * before the server has looked at `api_key`, so a refused key still reaches
 * this flag. `participantStreamEnded` is the correction — see its own note.
 *
 * The `?? 'participant-connect-failed'` fallback is the load-bearing clause:
 * a split session whose participant leg never started is degraded whether or
 * not any path remembered to record a reason. Two of the three paths were
 * console-only before this task, and a fourth (the acquire-throw sibling)
 * produced no signal at all — a rule that only fires on a recorded reason
 * would silently miss exactly the cases this indicator exists for.
 *
 * @param input.participantStreamEnded  Has the participant leg's OWN stream
 *   ended? False/absent means "not that we know of", which is NOT the same as
 *   "it is healthy" — and the difference is why this rule claims nothing on
 *   its own. A stream that is up but has produced no transcription is
 *   indistinguishable from a far side that simply has not spoken yet, and
 *   telling a healthy session to go fix itself is worse than reporting a real
 *   fault late. So the indicator waits for a POSITIVE fact — the stream
 *   ending — and never for the absence of one.
 *
 *   The window this exists for is narrow and specific: between the
 *   participant's `connect()` resolving and `setIsSessionActive(true)`, the
 *   leg's onClose early-returns without tearing anything down, so a stream
 *   that dies there leaves no trace anywhere else. After that point a dying
 *   participant leg ends the whole session, which the user cannot miss.
