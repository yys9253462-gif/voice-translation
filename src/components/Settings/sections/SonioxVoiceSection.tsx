/**
 * Soniox voice picker + voice cloning, wrapping the shared VoiceLibrarySection
 * (dropdown presentation): 28 built-ins as the preset group, cloned voices
 * (fetched live via the injected `source`) as the custom group. Where those
 * voices come from — BYOK talking to Soniox directly, or a managed account
 * talking to our backend — is entirely the caller's concern; see
 * `voiceLibrarySource.ts` for the seam. A null `source` (BYOK with no API key
 * pasted yet, or a managed account with no session) renders built-ins only.
 *
 * Create flow: record/upload are always available once a source exists (the
 * shared voice-library look, no gating checkbox) → client-side validation
 * (upload only: ≤10 MB, decoded duration 3-20s, mirroring NativeVoiceSection's
 * `validateVoiceClip` pattern) → the validated/recorded clip is staged as
 * `pending` rather than uploaded immediately, which opens
 * `SonioxCloneConfirmModal` for playback + naming + the consent statement
 * (folded into the modal's accept button) → on confirm, WAV-encode
 * (recordings only) → POST → poll until ready (seconds) → auto-select. A
 * mapped create failure (e.g. `voice_name_conflict`) keeps the modal open so
 * the user can rename and retry without losing the clip. `voice_failed` is
 * terminal: the entry renders a failed hint and can only be deleted.
 *
 * Managed accounts additionally cannot REPLACE a healthy voice by recording
 * again — the backend hands back the voice it already has and ignores the new
 * clip — so the create affordances are withdrawn while one exists, with a note
 * saying to delete first. See `managedVoiceBlocksCreate` below.
 *
 * Previewing (auditioning) a voice is a separate capability from the
 * create/delete affordances above: it needs a Soniox key to synthesize a
 * sample, which a managed account's source does not have, so it is gated on
 * `source.canPreview` rather than on `source` merely being non-null.
