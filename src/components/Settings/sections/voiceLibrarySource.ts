/**
 * The seam SonioxVoiceSection sits on.
 *
 * The section used to construct a SonioxVoicesClient from `settings.apiKey`
 * and short-circuit it to null for managed accounts, which is why the managed
 * twin could only ever show built-in voices. Lifting that construction out
 * turns "where do voices come from" into a parameter: BYOK talks to Soniox
 * directly with the user's project key, managed talks to our backend with a
 * session token, and the section itself stops knowing the difference.
 *
 * `canPreview` is part of the contract because auditioning a voice means
 * synthesizing a sample, which needs a Soniox key the managed user does not
 * have. That is a property of the SOURCE, not of the section.

 *
 *  - The clip is saved to this device BEFORE the build request goes out. The
 *    backend keeps no copy, so the clip is the only thing that can rebuild an
 *    evicted voice — and saving it only on success would lose it exactly when
 *    a retry needs it most.
 *  - `name` is ignored. The backend names voices itself, uniquely per build,
 *    because Soniox enforces name uniqueness per project.
 *
 * `accountId` is the Better Auth user id this source belongs to. It is what
 * the stored clip is filed under, so a recording made here can never be read
 * back — and re-uploaded — under a different account signed in on the same
 * device. The caller already mints a fresh source per account (see
 * ProviderSpecificSettings' `sonioxVoiceSource` memo), so passing it in keeps
 * "which account is this" a property of the source rather than something the
 * storage layer has to re-derive at call time.
