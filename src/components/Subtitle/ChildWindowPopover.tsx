/**
 * Hosts a popover in its own frameless, transparent OS window instead of
 * inside the parent window's DOM.
 *
 * Why: subtitle mode shrinks the main window to a ~200px bar, and any
 * in-window popover is clipped at its edge. The earlier fix grew the window
 * for the popover's lifetime, but resizing a transparent window flashes at
 * the compositor level (frame-sampled: the DOM stays continuous, the flash
 * is below it — un-fixable from the renderer). A child window sidesteps the
 * whole class: the subtitle window is never touched, the popover paints in
 * its own surface above everything, and it remains ordinary, fully-styleable
 * React DOM.
 *
 * Mechanics: Electron parses BrowserWindow options straight out of
 * window.open's feature string, so the renderer picks the frameless,
 * transparent, always-on-top shape itself; the main process only overrides
 * `show` and owns visibility (electron/popover-windows.js). The children
 * render into it through createPortal — they
 * stay part of THIS React tree, so handlers and context work unchanged — and
 * the parent's stylesheets are cloned into the child head so the same
 * component styles apply (the react-new-window copyStyles pattern).
 *
 * The window is created ONCE — hidden, via a main-process
 * setWindowOpenHandler override keyed on the window.open target name (see
 * electron/popover-windows.js) — and kept for the component's lifetime.
 * Opening is resize + move + a show over IPC. Creating on demand paid the
 * whole native-window + stylesheet-parse + first-composite bill inside the
 * click (a perceptible 100–250ms lag); creating hidden up front pays it on
 * subtitle-mode entry, where nobody is waiting on it.
 *
 * Electron-only by design: the extension overlay lives in an iframe with no
 * OS window to open, and keeps its in-window floating-ui popover.
