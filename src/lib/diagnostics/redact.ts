/**
 * The one secret-pattern list.
 *
 * Leaf module: imports nothing, so `logStore` can depend on it without gaining
 * an edge to anything else (see the design's import-graph section).
 *
 * Redaction lives at the SINKS — `logStore.addLog` and `sanitizeEvent` — not at
 * the call sites. Sink-side is the only placement that also covers the legacy
 * `addLog` callers and any future bypass; a call-site rule is a review comment,
 * not a guarantee.
 *
 * Every pattern below is traced to the line that produces the shape. A pattern
 * with no named source is not added: panel text is user-visible and
 * clipboard-exportable, so each rule has to earn its false-positive risk.
