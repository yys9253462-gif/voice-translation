/**
 * How a caught failure gets recorded. The one place console-vs-panel is decided.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md states the convention "errors logged to logStore for user visibility
 * via LogsPanel"; in practice 154 caught failures across 27 files went to
 * `console.error`/`console.warn`, where a user cannot see them, because nothing
 * decided where a failure should go — so every call site, and every review bot
 * reading that sentence, decided again (#441).
 *
 * The rule this module encodes:
 *
 *   - The console line always fires, synchronously, with the raw `cause`. That
 *     is the developer surface and it keeps stacks, object shapes and
 *     frequency intact.
 *   - A redacted one-sentence `message` reaches LogsPanel one microtask later.
 *     That is the user-diagnostic surface: advanced mode only, English,
 *     copy-pasted into bug reports.
 *   - Nothing here shows UI. A failure the user must act on becomes state on
 *     the owning store and a component renders it. A logger that can pop a
 *     toast is how "which tier is this?" gets re-litigated at every call site.
 *
 * Not a sink for session-scoped client failures: inside an `IClient` session a
 * client uses `handlers.onError` / `onDiagnostic` / `onRealtimeEvent`, because
 * only MainPanel knows which channel (speaker/participant) it is.
