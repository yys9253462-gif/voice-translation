/** Resolve a stored ttsVoice to a concrete in-model selection.
 *  - hasCustom=false (single/range, no custom-voice support): pass through
 *    ('' = default speaker, 'sid:n' = a speaker).
 *  - hasCustom=true (any custom-capable model — clip clone or style prompt):
 *    '' or a dead custom id → the language's default built-in; a builtin name
 *    the current model doesn't have (stale setting from a previously selected
 *    model, e.g. pocket's 'eponine' arriving at gpt-sovits) → the language's
 *    default built-in. Builtin names are only validated when a voice list is
 *    available — an empty list can't distinguish "unknown" from "not loaded".
 *  - `hasBuiltin=false` IS that distinction: the family exposes no built-in
 *    voices at all (capability `builtin: 'none'` — every clone-only family,
 *    qwen3_tts/omnivoice/moss and the four added 2026-09-03), so a stored
 *    `builtin:` name is not merely unverifiable, it is unusable: applying it
 *    means setVoice() against an empty preset list, which fails and takes TTS
 *    down with it. Such a selection falls back like any other dead one.
 *  - `customVoiceIds` must already be filtered to ELIGIBLE clips (the caller's
 *    job — see LocalNativeClient's use of `eligibleCustomVoices`), in the same
 *    order the voice picker lists them: `customVoiceIds[0]` IS "the first
 *    eligible clip" the fallback below picks.
 *  - R35: when no builtin default exists either (a clone-only family — no
 *    built-in voice at all, e.g. qwen3_tts, omnivoice — reached this function
 *    only because the caller's pre-init gate already found ≥1 eligible clip),
 *    an invalid selection falls back to the first eligible custom clip instead
 *    of '' — landing on no reference voice at all for a model that the caller
 *    already knows CAN speak would be worse than picking one deterministically. */
