/**
 * Acoustic echo *detection* from real captured audio (issue #227 follow-up),
 * replacing the removed device-name heuristic that previously lived in
 * audioUtils. EchoMonitor composes these detectors in production; this module
 * stays pure logic with no imports from the audio graph so the threshold sweep
 * (echoDetector.sweep.test.ts) can run it offline.
 *
 * ## What it decides
 *
 * "Is the microphone hearing a delayed copy of something we already know we are
 * playing?" — where the known signals are our TTS ring buffer and the participant
 * capture stream. Both are already available in-process, so no blind acoustic
 * analysis is needed.
 *
 * ## Why the envelope domain
 *
 * Waveform-domain correlation needs matched sample rates and phase alignment;
 * AGC, resampling and loudspeaker non-linearity all destroy that. The envelope
 * survives them, and a binary "is there echo" verdict does not need AEC-grade
 * precision. At a 100 Hz frame rate a 60-lag search over a 2 s window is ~12k
 * multiply-adds per tick — free.
 *
 * dB rather than linear envelope: acoustic attenuation is multiplicative in
 * linear terms and therefore a constant offset in dB, which mean-removal cancels
 * exactly. It also keeps quiet speech from being swamped by loud speech.
 *
 * ## What separates echo from normal conversation
 *
 * A high correlation peak alone is NOT enough — turn-taking produces one too
 * (the reply follows the remote utterance at a repeatable-looking offset). The
 * discriminators are:
 *
 *   1. the peak must beat the decoy lags (the `contrast` statistic) — a lag
 *      where echo physically cannot exist scoring just as well means the
 *      match is coincidence, and
 *   2. enough strong observations must agree on ONE lag bin over the voting
 *      history (`stepDecision`). An acoustic path has a fixed delay;
 *      conversational turn-taking scatters across the search range.

   * peak is a maximum over ~60 lags of a strongly autocorrelated envelope, so
   * its null distribution sits well above zero and unrelated speech routinely
   * peaks at 0.5-0.6 by multiple comparison alone.
   *
   * An earlier attempt estimated that null from the lag profile inside the
   * search range and failed outright — measured PSR was *higher* for headphone
   * turn-taking than for real echo. The reason is that a speech envelope stays
   * autocorrelated for several hundred milliseconds, which is wider than the
   * whole search range, so a true echo's profile is broad and high rather than a
   * sharp spike.
   *
   * The null therefore has to come from lags where an echo physically cannot be:
   * seconds away, where envelope autocorrelation has died out. There a genuine
   * echo scores near zero while a coincidence scores just as well as it does
   * anywhere else — which is exactly the contrast this measures.
