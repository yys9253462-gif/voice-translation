/**
 * What Soniox Text-to-Speech accepts: the model id, the built-in voice roster,
 * and the wire options that go with them.
 *
 * This module exists because `tts-rt-v1` → `tts-rt-v2` was not the drop-in the
 * vendor changelog promised. Soniox announced v2 as "fully compatible ... simply
 * replace the model name" (GA 2026-08-11, v1 removed 2026-08-31), but v2 drops
 * seven voices that v1 served — Claire, Elise, Jack, Maya, Meera, Noah, Sofia —
 * and rejects them with HTTP 400. Sokuji had the model id copied into five
 * modules and the default voice into four, so a rename-per-call-site migration
 * had five chances to miss one.
 *
 * A settings file written under v1 can still name one of the dropped voices.
 * That is deliberately not repaired here. The alternative — a rewrite table
 * mapping retired names onto a survivor — hides a roster change behind a silent
 * voice substitution, and has to be carried forever afterwards.
 *
 * What a stale name actually does depends on who is asking, because "not in
 * this roster" is also how the app recognizes a CLONED voice:
 *
 *  - BYOK: the name reaches the wire, Soniox answers 400, and the session
 *    degrades to subtitles the way any other TTS failure does.
 *  - Managed (Kizuna AI): MainPanel reads it as a cloned voice and runs the
 *    managed-voice preparation path first.
 *  - Settings: SonioxVoiceSection shows it as "(deleted voice)", never
 *    selectable. The delete affordance beside that row is managed-only
 *    (`removable: managed && !!source && managedListKnown`), so BYOK gets the
 *    label without a destructive action next to it.
 *
 * Only the first is a property of this module. The other two are the existing
 * "unknown id ⇒ cloned voice" heuristic meeting a roster that shrank, and they
 * behave that way for any name the roster does not list.
 *
 * The roster is a SNAPSHOT (source: `GET /v1/tts-models`, 70 voices,
 * 2026-08-11), not a contract: Soniox deleted the voice table from its own docs
 * in favour of that endpoint, and the roster moved (71 → 70) within hours of GA.
