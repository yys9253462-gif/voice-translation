 * allowance countdown, and the two endings that belong to the session rather
 * than to any one stream — the balance running out, and the granted duration

 * which is why they cannot live on a client: under split there are two, they
 * share one `max_session_duration_seconds`, and a per-leg announcement means
 * the same sentence twice (or once, in the wrong panel).
 *
 * Who drives it: MainPanel.connectConversation acquires one per Start, hands
 * each client its bundle and its role through ClientOptions.sonioxManaged, and
 * calls end() once every client is down. The started bit is NOT MainPanel's to
 * set — only the leg's own stream can tell an accepted stream from a socket
 * that merely opened, so each client reports `noteStreamAccepted(role)` and the
 * decision of what that is worth stays here. ProviderDescriptor.createClient is
 * synchronous and returns exactly one client, so it cannot own an awaited
 * acquire() without going async for all eleven providers.
