/**
 * ManagedVoicesClient — the managed (Kizuna AI) counterpart to
 * SonioxVoicesClient. Where the BYOK client talks to Soniox's /v1/voices with
 * the user's permanent project key, this one talks to our own backend with a
 * Better Auth session token, because managing voices needs a permanent Soniox
 * key that a managed user never has.
 *
 * The backend runs Soniox's 20-voice organization quota as a CACHE: an account
 * holds at most one voice, warm voices are kept, and the least recently used
 * one is evicted when someone else needs the space. Two consequences shape
 * this API:
 *
 *  - `ensure` is the only way to obtain a voice, and it is idempotent. Call it
 *    without a clip first: a warm slot answers immediately and no upload
 *    happens. Only a `clip_required` refusal means this device must upload.
 *  - The voice id is NOT stable across a rebuild. Every `ensure` response is
 *    authoritative and must be written through to settings.
 *
 * Errors are thrown as SonioxVoicesError with the backend's own slug as
 * `errorType`, so SonioxVoiceSection's existing error mapping works unchanged
 * whichever source is behind it.
