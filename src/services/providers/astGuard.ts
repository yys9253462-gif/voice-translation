/**
 * Guards the AST cross-stage hazard: `resolve()` resolves the asr and
 * translation stages of a direction independently (see resolveDirection's
 * doc comment), so a user can explicitly pick an AST-capable ASR model (e.g.
 * Granite Speech) as the TRANSLATION stage while the ASR stage of the same
 * direction resolves — auto or explicit — to a different model.
 * LocalInferenceClient only enters AST mode when `translationModelId ===
 * asrModelId` (LocalInferenceClient.ts); anything else constructs a real
 * TranslationEngine (opus-mt) against AST-only model files, which fails at
 * runtime with no gate and no note.
 *
 * This runs AFTER resolution, at the config-building boundary, rather than
 * teaching the resolver itself about a cross-stage constraint — resolving
 * each stage independently is deliberate (resolveDirection's doc comment).
 *
 * When the resolved translation is AST-capable but its id doesn't match the
 * resolved ASR id, the explicit translation selection is masked back to auto
 * and just that one direction is re-resolved. The manifest already excludes
 * AST-capable entries from auto-eligibility for the translation stage
 * (candidates.wasm.ts), so the fallback can never re-select the same hazard.
 * The masked selections object is never written back to settings — the
 * user's explicit choice is still meaningful if applied as the ASR
 * selection instead.
 *
 * Pure: the re-resolution is injected as `reResolve` rather than reached via
 * a static `useModelStore` import — a store importing this module back (see
 * modelStore.ts's `ensureSelectionReady`, which applies this guard to the
 * speaker direction before computing readiness) would otherwise cycle.
 * Callers that already hold a resolver in scope (LocalInferenceProviderConfig,
 * localParticipantConfig) pass `useModelStore.getState().resolve` bound to
 * the direction; modelStore.ts passes its own `get().resolve`.
