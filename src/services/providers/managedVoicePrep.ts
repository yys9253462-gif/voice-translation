/**
 * Make the account's managed custom voice usable, right before a session
 * starts.
 *
 * The backend runs Soniox's voice quota as an LRU cache, so a voice the user
 * selected days ago may have been evicted since. This routine claims the slot
 * (pinning it against eviction for the start window), rebuilds from this
 * device's stored clip if the cache entry is gone, and waits for the build.
 *
 * It NEVER throws. Every failure resolves to a reason, because the session is
 * still perfectly startable with a built-in voice — losing spoken output in
 * the user's own voice is a degradation, not a reason to refuse to translate.
 * The caller falls back for that session only and explains why afterwards; the
 * stored preference is left alone so the next session tries again.
 *
 * Deliberately outside MainPanel: `connectConversation` is a ~560-line
 * useCallback, and this routine has six branches worth testing. Deliberately
 * NOT inside `computeStartGate` either — that function is pure and is
 * evaluated by the subtitle window too, so an uploading ten-second side effect
 * there would break the property that lets both surfaces agree.

   *  `ensure`/`mine` aborts too (ManagedVoicesClient forwards it into its own
   *  AbortController, keeping the caller's cancel distinguishable from its
   *  own deadline at the catch site — see SonioxTtsRest.synthesizeOnce, the

   *  resolves through the same degrade path deadline exhaustion already
   *  does. `KizunaAISonioxProviderConfig.prepareToStart` always supplies one
