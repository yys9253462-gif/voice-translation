/**
 * Per-device consent for downloading native model cards whose catalog descriptor
 * carries a license that has to be acknowledged
 * (NativeModelCardSpec.license.requiresConsent — see
 * src/lib/local-inference/native/nativeCatalog.ts; that flag, not
 * `nonCommercial`, is the gate, since a license can need acknowledging while
 * still permitting commercial use). Acknowledged once per model id, persisted
 * to localStorage so it survives a reload.
 *
 * This is a per-device UI acknowledgment, not a legal record — a fresh browser
 * profile/device (or cleared storage) re-prompts, which is the intended
 * behavior. Deliberately a plain module rather than a zustand store: nothing
 * in the UI needs to re-render reactively when consent changes (the check
 * happens once, inside the Download click handler), so a tiny read/write pair
 * over localStorage keeps this self-contained.
