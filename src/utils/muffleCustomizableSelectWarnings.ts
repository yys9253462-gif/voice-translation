/**
 * Dev-only console filter for two React false positives.
 *
 * The customizable-select markup (<button><selectedcontent/></button> inside
 * <select>, rich spans inside <option>) is valid HTML in Chromium 135+ — the
 * select parser relaxation and appearance: base-select shipped together — but
 * React's validateDOMNesting still enforces the pre-relaxation content model.
 * Verified against react-dom 19.2.8 (latest stable) and the newest 19.3
 * canary (2026-05-29): the `case "select"` whitelist still ends at
 * option/optgroup/hr/script/template/#text and neither build mentions
 * <selectedcontent> at all. Nor does `case "optgroup"`, which still admits
 * only option/#text — so the <legend> that labels a group is a third false
 * positive. Until React catches up, every render of the provider, variant or
 * voice select logs alarming-but-false errors.
 *
 * The "will cause a hydration error" part of the message does not apply
 * either: this app client-renders through createRoot, so no hydration ever
 * happens.
 *
 * validateDOMNesting only exists in development builds — production is
 * untouched — so this filter is dev-only too, and matches as narrowly as the
 * message format allows: exactly the two parent/child pairs our select markup
 * uses on purpose. A genuinely wrong nesting (say, <div> in <option>) still
 * logs. Delete this file when React learns the new select content model.
